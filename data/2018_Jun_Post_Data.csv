4,e03xbx5,t3_8ok1pj,NoNoveltyNeeded,"I find it very odd that both Google and Apple both are making a big push towards digital well-being as headlining features this year. Is there a reason for that? Both announced app time limits, some sort of dashboard to show you how much time you spend in specific apps, how often you check your phone, etc. Is this just the next logical step that they both came to, do they know what each other are working on, or is there a demand from consumers for this stuff that I'd never heard of? I'm excited to use it all when released as I do think it's helpful, but I would have never thought of it so it's odd that both companies thought of it simultaneously.

I'm glad they're slowing down and working on improving software quality for a change, rather than prioritizing pushing out more features that might not really be ready yet while ignoring existing bugs.  I'm also fine with the fact that we didn't see any new hardware. We already know Apple is working on a lot of new stuff, but quality hardware products take time, especially with how complex consumer tech is becoming.

I ignore my phone a bunch nowadays so it’ll be nice to be able to properly quiet it down.  * The time tracking stuff is good, hopefully it’ll help me cut down on Reddit time!! * Audio playback on the watch? Maybe we’ll finally be able to have good third-party podcast apps on the watch now.  * Voice memos on the iPad, synced * Dark mode for macOS  A few of the presenters didn’t seem to comfortable on stage, but then again Craig didn’t always used to be this suave.   The macOS naming jokes were pretty funny.   Not a super exciting event over all, but I tempered my expectations.   It’ll be interesting to see if anything else comes out during the sessions.

Most new ""features"" are pretty much just app updates. Almost makes it seem that Apple went all out with iOS 11 last year and brought a lot of new stuff, especially to the iPads, so there's not much to show for iOS 12. Grouped notifications and group video chat are the most basic stuff that should not be a new feature in 2018.  WatchOS update.... well, people who do sports and are generally active will sure like it  tvOS... 4k, HDR, and Dolby Atmos support. Cool.   macOS is definitely where they went all out this time. Especially with the Dark Mode. I kinda feel bad for the iOS users because *again* they have to sit and wait or use alternative ""themes"" or venture into jailbreak to have their devices not blind them with bright screens and white UIs across the board. Stacks are basically automated folders but still nice that you can sort everything with one click instead of spending god knows how long manually dragging and sorting the content you store on your computer.  The sorta universal apps was the biggest announcements. A shame Apple is hesitant to the idea of bringing the best of macOS and iOS together in a hybrid system (imagine Apple's own Surface Pro with a full fledged macOS on it while also having the access to AppStore, for example). But this solution is pretty cool too. I'm glad Microsoft, Google, and now Apple are all venturing into unifying the Desktop and the Mobile, but the ideal scenario is where you launch up your mac, boot up the AppStore, download and install an iOS app, and it runs natively while supporting everything that both OS's can offer, sorta what ChromeOS is doing currently with native Android app support (albeit it's still in active development, I think Google has come a long way since they've started working on this a few years ago).

To be *powerful*, though, Siri needs to be able to trigger complex series of actions, and we’ve got that natively now.  For instance, I’ve made workflows for stuff I need to mix up at work where it makes an OmniFocus task to “Make XYZ,” and puts the recipe in the notes section.
