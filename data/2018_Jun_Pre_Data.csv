7,e02w4gj,t3_8oeiq0,smackythefrog,"I am happy. This will be my first WWDC with some rather up-to-date Apple devices that will likely benefit from all the features announced in a long time.   Until July of last year, I had a 2010 MBP 13"" that still saw OS updates, but I was just unhappy with how dated it was. It tried its damndest to keep me happy but I wanted a larger screen and a CPU that wasn't a freaking Core 2 Duo.   Then, about 3 weeks ago, I got an iPad Pro 10.5 on a good deal. Got the Pencil too.   So whatever macOS or iOS introduces tomorrow and throws at newer devices, I probably won't have to look at some compatibility list base on models for the first time in a long time.",26,1528093482.0

I used to do the same every year but I‚Äôm going in this year expecting nothing too drastic. It‚Äôs usually the same thing every year though (well in recent years it has been) and I‚Äôll come back here in around 5 hours time seeing a ton of complaints about why we didn‚Äôt get this and that. Also, remember that it‚Äôs a *developers* conference which is supposed to focus on software. Yes, we‚Äôve had hardware announcements in the past but it doesn‚Äôt mean we‚Äôre guaranteed nor promised new hardware, especially not at a developers conference.  So yeah, set your expectations low and you won‚Äôt be as disappointed. You might even be surprised depending on what is announced. Who knows. ",8,1528121009.0

Anticipating a bit of disappointment since I don't expect anything particularly novel plus fully anticipating no MacBook Pro hardware upgrades (what I'd actually appreciate). Yet, with all this negativity, I'm still excited and pumped. My brain says it ain't happening but my body don't give a fuck.    Going to brainstorm myself into some realistic hype right now so I can come away with something from this. Probably can be most interested in apple's push of AR tech/development. Plus the increasing investment in education based tech as a potentially huge market for their iPad-stylus pair plus the increasing number of educational apps/push for ed apps.   Would be great to see AR pushed (and brainstormed) as a means of improving education and the learning experience. Hoping for some dope AR concepts for **feasible** classroom integration (not just rich kid dream world stuff) at the very least. Still will be nice to see what apple envisions for the direction and usefulness of AR technologies. Think the iPad will play a big part in AR in the classroom, at least until glasses can be more affordably integrated by, perhaps, using smartphones as smartglass controllers and as the bulk of the computing power. Sky's the limit with this stuff, hope apple has some great ideas to ponder for ed and AR. ",1,1528117611.0

325,e035v0l,t1_e035af6,cocobandicoot,"The iPad Pro's premier difference was Apple Pencil support. That said, the iPad Pro was still a waste of money then ‚Äî by itself we were talking about nearly $700 plus hundred dollars on top of that for the Pencil. By that point you were in MacBook air territory, which is more capable than an iPad Pro in nearly every way except multi-touch.  While I do think putting Apple Pencil support on the standard iPad was a good move, it means that, for those that were willing to spend the money on an iPad Pro to begin with, the only real differences are its speakers, a nicer display, and just a tiny bit faster. For most users, they are not going to spend a premium for those minor conveniences.  It's my belief that what separates a ""pro"" machine from the alternative are features that pros/power users will take advantage of. I think the iPad Pro honestly should be wiped from Apple's roadmap and replaced with an entirely different product‚Ä¶ something that does far more than what the iPad Pro ever did and that is more capable than a laptop.  I believe the answer is something more like a two-in-one... something similar to the form factor of Microsoft's Surface Book. The rumors are already saying that Apple is working on such a device, which I hope comes to fruition, because the Surface Book is an excellent form factor, in my opinion. However, it runs Windows, which is disappointing as it the operating system hasn't been optimized for touch. By ""dream machine"" is a MacBook and iPad and one that runs iOS apps when used as a tablet and full macOS when used as a laptop. Call it ""MacBook Pro.""  Hey, I can dream, can't I?",3,1528113667.0

Why would I ever spend more money on an iPad Pro if it really doesn't **do** anything else?  The iPad Pro need some massive hardware differentiation to be worthwhile for me, or most anyone, to buy.

All interfaces will be carved out for the specific device, so the Mac interface will stay the same as it is, and the iPhone interface will stay the same as well. That way, everything will work as is (no ""iOSification"" of Mac), but the name itself will stay across all devices.  It could be Apple OS 1.0 Mojave, for example, then next year, Apple OS 2.0 Sequoia. There would be 1.0.1, 1.1, ... 1.5 updates, of course, and all devices would be updated at the same time for tight integration.   It'd be simple and easy, and much easier for support too - ""I'm having issues with Apple OS 1.2.1, it's not syncing properly!"" ""Okay, what device?"" ""My iPad. My Mac and iPhone works fine.""
