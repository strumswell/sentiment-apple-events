No dark mode was a disappointment for iOS for sure. But it's coming, that was obvious. iOS was a bliss, almost everybody wanted speed and stability, with more customization and for some reason people are disappointed. For fucks sake, they focused on older devices. That's a good thing, since almost nobody does that nowadays. We shouldn't get use to it, but at least it feels like the long\-awaited cleanup of iOS.  macOS was great too, but I missed the notification update to bring it to iOS12 level. Right now notifications are even worse than on iOS 11. I really hope they do something about it. Dark mode is awesome, teasing of the mac UIKit is awesome.

Broad disappointment was inevitable.  Even on the software side, we've known since Feb that Apple plans a thin feature set for iOS 12 and macOS 10.14, and will instead be focusing on internal QA processes and stability. It's a shame it took a disastrous release for the change in direction, but if this keynote feels light on features then it's a sign Apple's taking the problem seriously. Honetly, my concern is that it's not light _enough:_ Apple seems to be taking on some significant app redesigns and a whole new OS theme.

The more you try to do, the more you get into a situation of one hand not knowing what the other is doing. This problem is one as old as the notion of intently working together towards a common goal. You end up as a giant tentacle monster of a corporation where one tentacle is trying to tighten the lid as another tentacle is trying to take it off. Microsoft has, in the past, had a huge problem with this.  And despite its size, Apple actually apparently tries to keep its dev teams pretty lean. And this has been the trend in software development and seems to have superior results \-\- Microsoft's software quality has gone way up ever since they've gone lean. Facebook, OTOH, is having \*huge\* problems with software quality, and many that have worked there have credited it to having huge unmanageable teams.  It seems software development is especially susceptible to scaling in organizations. It makes sense \-\- software developers have to be trusted to function relatively independently while also coordinating with others, something that requires very effective communication. And communication seems to be the limiting factor in scaling organizations.  The amount of communication seems to scale exponentially with increasing organization size. And look at what sort of technologies have seen expansions in the scale of organizations \-\- \*communication\* technologies. Email, for example, was absolutely huge. For something developer\-focused, version control, and especially git, have enabled software teams to function better at much larger sizes. But there are still limitations.  Scaling organizations tend to work best when you have a lot of functions that can operate relatively independently. For example, horizontal and vertical integrations.  So yeah, it does kind of come down to, ""focus on performance"" or ""focus on features."" Choose one, the other will suffer.  **Why can't Chevy make a Suburban\-style SUV that gets 40 mpg and gets to 60mph in under 10 seconds?
