60,e8qehk7,t3_9so41z,HFoletto,"About the new Macbook Air, apple claims that the CPU is a [""1.6GHz dual-core 8th-generation Intel Core i5 processor with Turbo Boost up to 3.6GHz""](https://www.apple.com/shop/buy-mac/macbook-air). At first I already thought this was really odd, because since it's 8th gen, it should have been quad-core. So I decided to check [all the i5 8th processors](https://ark.intel.com/products/series/122597/8th-Generation-Intel-Core-i5-Processors), and there is none that matches that specs.      Is it a typo? What is the actual processor apple is using in the new Macbook Air?      Edit: That wasn't a typo, it is a 5W chip, part of Intel's Amber Lake family, the model is **[i5-8210Y](https://ark.intel.com/products/189912/Intel-Core-i5-8210Y-Processor-4M-Cache-up-to-3-60-GHz-)**, which Intel hasn't added to their public product specifications database until just recently.

My current needs are pretty simple, but I have pretty much bought into the Apple ecosystem; iPhone SE, airpods, Macbook 12"", Apple TV 4th gen (that actually came with a DTVNOW subscription), and Apple Watch S3.  I like Apple and their products, but when it comes time to upgrade or replace these items, I don't even know what's out there.  I don't really care about the specs too much, because aside from a Chromebook, I could probably find a laptop to replace the Macbook.  I could probably replace the ATV with a Roku or when I upgrade my TV (which is super old), just get a smart TV that runs what I need it to.  The iPhone, airpods, and Watch S3 are work together so well, that's where I wonder whether it would be worth it to switch to Android.  I don't know if there's a combo of watch/phone/earbuds, regardless of price, that matches what the Apple products do.  It will probably be a couple of years before I really have to make any decisions, but it's too bad that Apple is forcing people who want to stick with them to look elsewhere.  It's not even as much about what I can afford vs what I'm perceiving as Apple gouging its customers.  Then again, I'm going to Disneyland next month, so maybe I'm just a total sucker.

The iPads are plenty powerful enough to do what I want, but they've been historically hamstrung by iOS.  My needs are pretty simple, really; once I can i) easily transfer files to/from an iPad without needing special apps or having to commit to 100% cloud saves and ii) easily open multiple documents to work with at once I'll be able to use an iPad.  I don't think I can do either of these things yet, and so I ended up with a Macbook 12"" which has worked fine for what I need, but I'd actually save a bit by going with an iPad.

2009,e8qhsnj,t1_e8qfyj1,FuckFuckingKarma,"I'm not really invested in the Apple ecosystem because I'm a poor student who prefers spending less money and compromising on the experience. My take on it is the following:  **Android vs iPhone**: Both do the same in slightly different ways. OS wise the difference is very small to me. Arguments like integration with Apple products and better App availability are strong arguments for iPhones, but I really don't use many different apps and I feel like my non flagship android phone does everything I need it to, has a camera that is quite decent, and is responsive. You probably won't find bluetooth earpods that work as well as the Airpods.  **MacOS vs Windows:** Windows is a buggy mess. I hate it and wish I didn't have to use it. If you can look past the design consistencies the experience is pretty similar and Windows has a lot of productivity features if you spend some time learning them. However, be prepared to spend some time being frustrated with drivers behaving weird and other strange OS bugs. Also, it looks ugly.  **Apple TV vs Chromecast:** My girlfriend has an Apple TV, I have a Chromecast. In my opinion the experience is exactly the same except the Chromecast is cheaper.  I don't know if the Apple TV has more advantages if you're more invested in the Apple Ecosystem, but that didn't matter for me. At the beginning I was annoyed about not having a remote, but I think it's way easier to do stuff with my phone than with the Apple remote.  **Wearables:** Haven't used them. I prefer a good old dumb mechanical watch for the style ;)  \---  If I didn't care about money I might get an IPhone, but would probably get a flagship Android phone because I'm more used to the UI and have spend some time getting Android well integrated with my other devices. I would definitely buy a Macbook laptop and just attach screen, keyboard and eGPU for more desktop oriented workloads. I wouldn't get an Apple watch because my wrist would be taken up by a much more expensive dumb watch (but that's just preference).",3,1540919109.0

Idk, im sure its going to happen but if they are sticking it out with lightning until that happens, mark my words im jumping ship to android.
