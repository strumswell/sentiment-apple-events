186,e5v0ym9,t3_9f9b31,alway5inf1n1t3,"I found the entire presentation to be a nice little blip on the weeks radar...but is anyone else slightly disappointed in everything except for the watch? I mean, listen, I love these events way more than I should. But I found myself very lackluster in what I was watching. New phones, okay that's fine. But as someone with the X, the Xs is honestly the exact same minus the smart HDR, possibly faster FaceID unlock time, and a few other minute things. The cameras are the same, the recording capability is the same, battery life is marginally different. But aside from the larger Xs, what was ""new?""   &#x200B;  That's what I found I was wondering. I understand rolling out small hardware changes across a year or two, maybe switch things up with the camera, maybe make it thinner or have a better battery life. But at this point, we're not going to see new iPad pro's for a hot minute, nor are we going to receive any sibilance of an update on the AirPods or airpower. Like yes, I understand that it was a year from when the watch was announced to when it was released...but that's a watch. not a mat that wirelessly charges devices. Granted, if the airpower mat is having combustibility issues or overheating that's understandable, but I cannot wrap my head around the fact that we have these world class engineers that design phones and such of this caliper yet they cannot solve a slight thermodynamic issue?   &#x200B;  More to the point, it would have been much better if they spent their time announcing the watch and just quickly showing the phones. It just seemed sad to me how much they milked the ""smart HDR"" feature. I never found their current HDR to be shitty in any sense, in fact I love it. As for the adjustable depth of focus for the new phones, if that is not brought to the x I'll be quite sad. Again, the x has the same camera array, and if the adjustable depth is truly reliant on the 8-cores of processing power then that's pretty sad. It would be pretty cool to have a borderline light field camera in my phone.   &#x200B;  Apologies if this all seemed to be a rant, but I wish Apple would focus more time on really demonstrating what they're capable of, even if that means they don't release new phones for a year. I'd rather have a two-year gap with a hell of a lot of new physical features instead of yearly, minute updates that just ruffle peoples feathers.   &#x200B;  p.s. - Apple, I love you a bunch but please continue to be the innovating force and not a trend-setting/trend-following force.",24,1536779902.0

The things i've been most looking forward to with Apple seem to never come around:  * Air Power release  * Darkmode for iOS  * New iPad Pro with an edge to edge OLED display  * Air Pod 2  * Upgrade to both free and paid iCloud storage  Maybe next year, but for now i'm still quite content with last years offerings.",10,1536778597.0

They come and go. This technology allows for more longitudinal monitoring of the rhythm which is great for helping physicians identify issues. The FDA clearance is HUGE.

Here's why it's Apple's fault:  There was a third party Spotify Apple Watch client being developed by redditor /u/typealias called Spotty (and got renamed to Snowy.) Before it got publicly released, Spotify hired him to integrate his watch app into the official Spotify app.  However, the likely reason we haven't seen anything yet is because there was a loophole in watchOS that many developers were taking advantage of to allow for music to play in the background. In watchOS 4, [Apple removed this loophole,](https://marco.org/2017/08/10/removed-send-to-watch) and this probably set the development of Apple Watch support for Spotify back a bit, as it was likely relying on the loophole.   As it stands right now (watchOS 4), the only way to play audio on the Apple Watch is using the `WKAudioFilePlayer` API, which ""has major shortcomings, bugs, and non-ideal behaviors for making a usable [music] app"" [according to  Overcast developer Marco Arment.](https://marco.org/2017/08/10/removed-send-to-watch)   However: watchOS 5 does include a new [""Background audio mode""](https://i.imgur.com/B6iUb5P.png) for developers to use. While Spotify has a habit of not talking about upcoming plans or features, I would think it's highly likely they're finally going to be able to offer a watchOS app, not because it was ""up to them,"" but because Apple finally put the tools needed for Spotify developers to be able to create the app.",15,1536779515.0

Not even gonna lie this minimum improvement trend has spread to other companies as well including Samsung and Google. I honestly expected nothing new at all, these speed improvements are the bare minimum they can do and on paper they sound pretty solid. That being said there are always going to be enough Apple fanboys to justify these minimum upgrades and Apple will always turn a profit on their products.

AirPods are fantastic. Spendy, maybe, but if I lost them tomorrow I'd be at the Apple store buying a new set the same day. They're in my pocket every single day. They've become everyday carry.  Not having a headphone jack hasn't really been an annoyance as a result. I can plug in a lighting-port headphone if I really need one (the phone came with a set, and I keep it in my laptop bag when I'm traveling and expect to do a LOT of earphone-listening). The phone also has a dongle if I'm really keen on using some fancy headphone with my iphone, but I never have because the AirPods handle 99% of my listening needs... Yes, you can't charge while using the lightning port for earphones, but the phone has enough battery life that I've never been in a situation where I needed charging and wired earphones.

The only new high end devices that don't use USB-C are iPhones/iPad and I highly doubt Apple will ever shift to USB-C for those since they want to keep their license fees that they get for their proprietary cable. Apple makes it's customers pay them $4 per connector (so someone buying a pass-through cable pays Apple an $8 fee)  to buy accessories or cables from 3rd parties plus the ""certification fee"" that accessory makers have to pay for each product variant which gets passed into consumers.  Now, there is nothing wrong with royalty/licensing fees for connectors as that is how standards bodies recoup the money they spent developing the connectors/ports, but the licensing/royalty fees are typically MUCH lower. For example, the licensing fees for HDMI is $0.05/unit. The licensing fees for USB ranges from $0 (if you are a USB-IF member or a vendor of a member), a one-time fee of $5,000 per vendor and you don't want to use the USB logo on your product, or a one-time fee of $5,000 per vendor plus $3,500 every 2 years if you do want to use the USB logo. Alternatively, you can become a member of the USB-IF for $4,000/year. So if they wanted to, Apple, as not just a member of the USB-IF but a founding member of the the USB-IF and board member, could use USB-C on the iPhone for $0 but would be unable to charge accessory fees for using 3rd party accessory makers.",1,1536780932.0

Insanely annoying. It was very nice to get a proper phone afterwards.  People who've never had to deal with this garbage are only inconvenienced in that their market now is severely limited -- Samsung and OnePlus and a few others here and there.  But the biggest problem has to be for people who don't have headphones these days.  >This is not a problem, and you don't need those ""high-end bluetooth headphones"",  my headphone is a QC25 from bose and as far as I know it's not bluetooth.  Oh. Lightning? What headphones do you use for *every other device you own*? Do you not have a laptop, tablet, video game console, or... you know, anything else?  >You have an adaptator in the box...  Are you trying to pretend that's a good thing?  >Mine just stays on the headphone's cable all day. My cable is now longer, big deal.  Ohhhhh, you're one of these people who is actually okay with playing with dongles. The Omnia had a dongle. I used it a couple of times. Dongles are massive piles of ass. Just one extra moving part to lose. And again, for people with more than one device, you have to keep taking it off and putting it back on.  And on top of that, you can't put it into your phone while it's plugged into the charger. And before you go bragging about your wireless charging -- Again, Android had it years ago, it's old news. It's nice, but you're kind of defeating the purpose by introducing multiple wires back into your setup.  Nobody wants a dongle. Nobody likes dongles. That's why we developed the 3.5mm standard, years ago, and put it on every. single. phone. everywhere. And everybody could finally just own nice headphones they use on everything.

From what i gather from you is that the only time we can say it's not justified is when the officials say so and not anytime before. So in regards to these 1k tier devices we will find out... or we already have found out and it is justified ,1,1536783630.0

You know that other sizes of SD cards exist right?   Why does it matter what you think is sufficient now? When the iPhone originally came out, 16gb was considered a lot look at us now. And now that phones are evolving much more slowly now, cheaply available local storage is more important cause it's less likely that you'll buy new models. Even apple knows this, they made a big deal about iOS 12 speeding up old hardware.  But regardless of all that, how can it possibly be worse to have the option to relatively cheaply expand your storage if you need it? You're literally arguing against having a feature?",1,1536800545.0
11007,e5w1rx8,t1_e5vnc4f,josephgt,"I was on iphone until a few months ago. Started with the 4, then 4s, 5, 5s, 6+, then 7. I've had macbooks, had an apple watch, way back in the day I had a Powerbook G4 when those existed. Had the original iPod nano, the iPod touches, all of it.  I finally switched to an s9 this year. I appreciate a lot of things about apple. One day, I may return. But that will not happen until they stop overcharging for storage.  Both on phones and on their computers. The jumps in price for such small amounts of storage are ridiculous. One can easily see the differences in cost of storage in all different sizes and types. HDD's, SSD's, M.2's, SD cards, etc. Just compare it on amazon.  I know that the difference between 128gb and 256gb isn't even close to over $150 (for SSD's or M.2's) So why do they have to gouge you that hard on macbooks? The price is already inflated as it is, I understand a markup but that's well taken care of with the original price of the laptop.  Absolutely do a markup on the SSD too. But not that much, that feels like gouging, and that's what put me onto a Lenovo Yoga 730 this time around over a macbook.  Hell, I wanted a macbook so I could have a bootcamp partition so I could have windows and macOS. But the price they want for a tiny amount of extra storage doesn't justify the price, even with their shiny OS or sleek designs that I enjoy. I like their products, but I just can't get milked like that anymore until they change that.  I'll take the 64gb phone with an SD card slot I can add an extra 128GB to my phone for only $40, versus the iphones that were asking a $100+ difference between 128gb and 256. That's what drove me away.",1,1536816470.0
