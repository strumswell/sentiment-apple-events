I'm super excited to see where they go with it, but a couple things have me a little worried:  This is one of the devices where I really don't want super thin bezels due to the nature of the way you naturally hold it. Phones you basically cradle in your palm, but iPads you tend to hold more like a book. I know they would probably get palm-rejection working right, but I'm afraid my hands would always be getting in the way of the screen all the time. The 10.5 is perfect in regards to bezels IMO.  There are rumors that the smart connector will be moved to where the device is in portrait mode if you use a keyboard with it, but this just seems too insane to me (however, apparently some of the leaked cases coming out seem to support this rumor, but I can't imagine this being true).  There is also a rumor that it will use FaceID but it will only work in portrait mode. I definitely use my iPad in landscape mode 95+% of the time, so this would be super annoying. Again, just a rumor and it seems crazy Apple would do this so I think this is highly unlikely.

This means that bluetooth carries significant audio quality losses with it. * Furthermore, bluetooth is much more expensive than simply having a wired connection. As a result, bluetooth offers a worse audio quality than wired at the same price point, which is the entire point of buying a product that is made to produce sound. * Bluetooth also has issues with connection drops, which is something that simply doesn't happen when using a wired connection. * Bluetooth requires the use of batteries, which makes the product bulkier and heavier. * Bluetooth devices has a much lower life expectancy, especially since most earphones/headphones don't even have replaceable batteries. This is a result of the fact that li-ion batteries deterioate significantly with cycling, which is what happens every time you use and charge it. * Lastly, having a pair of headphones/earphones with batteries mean that you have one more thing that needs to be charged, and if you forget it, then you might not even be able to play music on your headphones. If you have a wired pair of headphones, then you don't ever have to worry about this. **They just work.**  >So is Bluetooth.  No, it's not. You do know that the audio industry encompasses more than smartphones, right? Instruments, components, amplifiers and so on. Do you think they connect with each other through bluetooth, which has massive audio quality losses? No, everything connects through AUX jacks, as it doesn't have any losses or drops in connection.  >Except for the billions of phones sold without them.  Firstly, electronic devices encompasses more than just smartphones. We're talking cameras, laptops, tablets, 2-in-1s, TVs and so on. Secondly, there are vastly more smartphones sold with **SD card** slots than without.  >20$ nets you 100 gb of storage either Google. That isn't a fortune and if it is you should probably refrain from buying a smartphone in the first place.  People prefer to own their own data and have full control over it, instead of giving it to Google. It's also more inconvenient to necessitate internet access in order to simply access your own files. Additionally, it's slower to have to go online to load your files than simply having it on the much faster memory on your phone. Lastly, you can install and load apps from your SD card, while this isn't possible from the cloud. The SD card is much more versatile and efficient.  >The cloud does this but with no plug.  Once again, there are more devices in this world than smartphones. Furthermore, the transfer of data is instant with an SD card, while it all has to be loaded by a device. However, this necessitates that the electronic device can use an app to access such a thing as a cloud service, as well as having an internet connection. A lot of electronic devices who has an SD card slot can't do this. Good luck transfering files from your camera to your smartphone. The camera can't access your Google cloud service. Furthermore, cloud services compresses files, which ruins the quality, while an SD card doesn't do any of this.  >This is just embarrassing.
