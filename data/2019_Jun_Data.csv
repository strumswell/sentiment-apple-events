Hello Music, TV, and Podcast apps. * Sidecar * Voice Control accessibility * Sign in with Apple * Silence unknown callers * Mac Pro * Pro Display XDR  Definitely the highlights for me. This new Mac Pro boasts some serious power, and the fact that modularity and expansion is a theme for the new Mac Pro says incredibly a lot about them focusing to please their Pro users. Not fond of the design personally, imo, but you can tell there is a focus on airflow and that pleases me. I wouldn't be so quick to put all your focus on the $999 stand (the VESA mount attachment will be the top seller anyway). It's a block of aluminum with a fancy mechanism so I'm not exactly sure how to justify that price tag. Focus on this being an incredible 6k display.

Lots of companies are currently making devices that are only iOS or Android compatible. This is especially annoying if you have a home with plenty of smart devices. The majority of the work I get done at home is on my Macbook Pro. I can't check most of my smart home appliances/products on my Macbook Pro. Sure it's easy to just pick up your phone or iPad, but it's a little inconvenient to do so when you're already on your Macbook (unless you have a program that runs virtual Android or iOS).   Wouldn't it be nice if you could unlock your door, check your security cameras, start your washer/dryer, run your kitchen appliances (brewing coffee and starting the dish washer specifically), and so on. There are a few devices with apps for the Mac like the Ring Doorbell and the Nest Thermostat and it's something you can't live without once you have it. You're kind of forced to carry a phone or iPad on you at all time when your whole experience could be seamless.  Thanks for reading my rant.

But because the monitor was always on the screen attached to the stand, we all assumed it would be a packaged deal.  A lot of professional users won't need the stand, so I can understand why they would've gone this route. I guess you can think of it as a $6000 package, and if you can do without the stand, you can save $1000.  The VESA mount plate should be included with the purchase of the monitor.",13,1559590743.0

My favorite part was when they announced the displays pricing, everyone somewhat clapped (we all knew this was going to be fucking expensive, lets not kid ourselves), but when the guy then added, “and 999 for the stand” and people just gasped that even the presenter tripped over his next words. I don’t think there was a single Apple executive there who did not squirm in their seat when that happened.   The rest. Cool. Basic features that we have been begging for. A new volume UI. There should be genuine tweet explaining why we have to wait until the end fo 2019 to get this. This was a design flaw for years. Maps, it looks awesome and they had to brag how they rebuilt it from the ground up JUST TO give us what Google has been giving us....... StreetView..... The issue STILL lies in Apples navigation and its picking of routes. It just doesn’t fucking work, lol.   All this Animoji stuff, it’s cool but it’s really not used at all. I have had a handful of friends ever send me one of these things. I’m sure the market is there, just not for a male in his 30’s.   Mac Pro.... I don’t need one, but for those who were waiting, cool? Seems like you got what you wished for in a lot of ways!  IPad os. Did not get to fully watch that part of the keynote but it seems like a step in the right direction. But, this is starting... Today.. Meaning, this $1,700 iPad set up I’m on wont really be “unleashed” for another 16 months.... Meaning, next WWDC they give us a bit more, then wait for that release.. So for now, still a glorified IPod touch with confusing finger gestures that you get lost trying to remember.   EDIT: I just saw IPad OS... I’m sorry, but, what in the hell is going on. There are so many gestures to remember this is getting to be a disaster. Drag here, hope it attaches, double click here, do this, do that...

They’re selling a monitor that looked great. Then tacked on a VESA adapter for $200. You’re kidding right. And to stand the damn thing I need to spend a thousand dollars.  Please I beg you. Explain to me what justifies that price tag. Or did you already preorder?  Edit:   The watch is now always listening.   Keyboard got a swipe feature which is how many years late now?  Mac is... getting TV?   An actual positive is using an ipad as a second screen. Pretty cool actually hopefully it works right.   And siri sounds a bit more normal.

6927,epxbhdn,t1_epx6h74,itsjust_khris,"How is it underpowered, the thing seems to be a beast. I doubt Apple will use Nvidia ever again, for good reason, would Nvidia put in as much work for it's partners as it seems AMD has with this.  I'm sure Apple didn't design that MPX module entirely on their own.  PCIe 3.0 being in the computer is a result of Apple continuing to use Xeon processors, perhaps AMD couldn't guarantee a Zen 2 Threadripper or Epyc chip in time?  &#x200B;  Still hardly anything besides the fastest networking cards (200gb/s) and m.2 storage are bottlenecked by this.  &#x200B;  1.5TB is the max amount of memory this xeon can fit I believe, it's still a lot of memory whether it's something not seen before or not. Furthermore this is available to Mac users for the first time.  &#x200B;  My concerns on this are mainly on thermals, servers that use the cooling method they are using here are extremely loud to get the airflow required, Apple won't do this of course which means it will thermal throttle, I can't see a 28 core xeon and 4 gpus being cooled by this thing.  Don't forget that FPGA accelerator, that is a unique feature. Of course ingesting all that 8k footage would likely be served well with a PCIe 4.0 ssd :/  &#x200B;  I can see how there's nothing that seems groundbreaking here but I think they have come up with a competent product.

However, I think saying “just a new way of implementing” is downplaying some of the fantastic engineering that went into the announcements (both hardware and software). Getting the Apple Pencil latency down to 9ms is AMAZING and makes a big difference in how it feels to use such a thing (https://youtu.be/vOvQCPLkPt4). The thermal design of the Mac Pro alone is ridiculous — if it really pumps 1400W (the same power as a small space heater) without being boiling-hot to touch or sounding like a jet engine (which it reportedly doesn’t), that is a modern freaking miracle. There are existing solutions similar to Sidecar, but being able to do it WELL without an extra hardware dongle is also a fantastic feat of engineering. (Of course it could be terrible, but Apple’s track record is pretty good with this kind of thing.) And stuff like Catalyst, the new ARKit features (real-time motion capture without special hardware or a mocap suit?!), and SwiftUI may not sound as impressive if you’re not a dev (this is WW*D*C after all, not one of their more consumer-focused shows) — but if you spend your days writing code, it’s pretty mind-blowing that they can do any of it, much less all of it the same year.

I have no doubt that Apple could have spared the resources to develop a dark mode really practically anytime during the last ten years and that’s also not the central issue here. It’s about how you spend the resources and thinking through all the implications.  Dark Mode touches practically every aspect of the OS. Every single element has to be considered and thought through (with Dark Mode you often lose shadows as a tool to work with, for example). You have to be confident that you can find good solutions for all of those cases. Every single app has to be reworked. Developers have to be given the right tools to do this work in an appropriate way that leads them to appropriate results.  Those are the implications for the here and now. The implications for the future are that you always have to think about Dark Mode when implementing anything new. You have to test, you have to invest effort to always make everything work with Dark Mode.  A feature like this is like taking up debt because it means you will always have to spend more resources in the future to make everything work. Additionally, the surface area for bugs increases.  Given that there are thousands of potential things you can do I don’t think it is at all obvious when you should do Dark Mode or if you should do it at all. Because it’s definitely not just a paint job.  All of this is certainly not to say that implementing dark mode this year and not earlier was the right move.

I'm saying it's not forced in regards to the company itself being diverse. If everyone at the company is white and they picked some scrub who happened to not be white to present then I'd agree that was a chosen diversity play but I doubt there's only white people working at apple. I don't agree with saying it was forced because that implies it was a decision made only for race and while disregarding those individuals skills.   Just saying oh let's pick the most qualified every time is great in principle but logic such as that always results in bias because the right person for the job historically will be argued by some corporate politicking as someone who has political cachet in the company thus disadvantaging others for not being a particular race.

Because of personal bias, it’s highly possible that there is preferential choice of race in the hunt for best candidates. And this is wrong. Unfortunately, while trying to curb this phenomenon, many a times, a lesser deserving ends up getting the chance just because the one with authority is trying to conform to a societal fad/custom/necessity. Personally, I find the latter as well disagreeable.   I am from India, and India has reservations based of caste (can be compared to racial discrimination in the world stage) just because certain castes were always dominated by a few others. Now, in our attempt to bring the equality back, we’ve instituted caste based reservations. For example, if a college has total 100 vacancies, 20 must go to Caste 1, 15 to Caste 2, etc. Because of these reservations, we create a society of callous youths who don’t care about working hard, because they know they’ll always get good enough jobs, thanks to the reservation system. This is what I disagree with. We are trying to compensate our past mistakes with more mistakes. Personally, in this case, I feel those with weaker financial strength should only be supported, and that too only for education.
