11,ejcx4ls,t3_b5epdq,deleted,"What am I missing with Apple TV? I don't own one so I'm not completely in the loop with what you can do with it but from my outside view it seems pointless to buy one now. With the Apple's TV+ app coming to smart TV providers like Samsung and now the Apple TV+ app being supported on Amazon's Fire Stick, I'm really not seeing a reason to get one.  I'm confused as to why you would buy one when you can download the app on your TV if it supports it or buy the cheaper alternative in the Fire Stick. What do you get for your extra ¬£100?  Apple TV + is likely to be a monthly subscription so does it matter which device you decided to use to stream it? Wouldn't it be better to save the extra ¬£100 and put that towards the subscription cost if you do decide to get it.   Apple TV ¬£149  Apple TV 4k ¬£179 - ¬£199  Compared to   Fire TV ¬£39.99  Fire TV 4k ¬£49.99  Then whatever Apple TV+ costs likely $5-10 added on.  The only way I see the benefit in buying an Apple TV is unless you get Apple TV+ free with it for sometime. ",75,1553540137.0

Presentation was too pretentious, but that's not surprising. $10/month is very reasonable and free family sharing is great.  Card looks awesome, could be a big shake-up for the credit card industry the same way Apple Pay was for payments.  Arcade is intriguing, love the cross-device syncing and offline play. Need to see more details on games and pricing to see if it's worth it.  &#x200B;  Second hour:  Holy fuck, this was one of the most cringeworthy, pretentious things I've ever seen. By far the worst part of any Apple event ever. No pricing on tv+, no concrete details, just celebrities lecturing us about social issues and how earth-shattering and progressive their new TV programs are gonna be.

Credit card seems like a decent addition to my wallet. I haven‚Äôt bothered to get a 2% card yet so that‚Äôll be nice. 3% on Apple stuff is a nice bonus too.

I supposed I would sign up if I was 18 and didn't have a credit card yet and was looking to build credit, but there is zero reason for me to actually sign up at this stage in my life.   * Don't go on and on patting yourself on the back about how ethically superior Apple is with regards to privacy (I do appreciate this) but then team up with *Goldman Sachs*.  * Steven Spielberg decides that his love for money is greater than his hate for streaming  * The jumpsuit was genuinely my favorite part of the event",77,1553540199.0

Tidal's pitch was around higher-quality audio. Turns out that wasn't a compelling market.  2. Apple acquired Tidal for its original content, which may have served Apple Music well.   &#x200B;  My conclusion: Apple TV+ has a solid shot at releasing compelling original content. The biggest hurdle for content distribution is growing your viewer base. Apple already has a distinct advantage in that regard, since a billion people own their devices. Now all they have to do is release good content, which is arguably as easy as throwing money at A-list talent with proven track records. ",-1,1553540555.0

1006,ejg6f0c,t1_ejg5a62,baummer,"Let's recap, starting with the comment in this thread (Apple 'It's Show Time' | Post -Event Megathread"") that I replied to:  > **GoldenJoe24:** Wow. I never imagined their hardware would collapse so quickly. Withdrawing instead of offering an SE2 or even an iPod? Where will they go after they get pushed out of media services? This is the exact opposite of the strategy that made them successful under Jobs.  > **Me:** They usually have hardware keynote events towards the Fall and software in the Spring/Summer. No one should have been surprise to be honest.  So here we can see that I addressed your comment about hardware, in which I said that hardware keynote events are _usually_ in the Fall.   > **GoldenJoe24:** No, they have traditionally used the spring keynote to update non-flagship devices like SE and iPod. This more of Cook not listening to the market.  > **Me:** They did that one time  Here we can see that I countered your point that they only did that one time (given that there has only been one SE for example).  > **GoldenJoe24:** Literally just did it less than a week ago. Remember the whole Airpods/iPads thing? You might be spending too much time on the internet. It's affecting your brain. Short term memory is always the first thing to go.  This is where things fall off the rails. _You_ discuss product releases from last week that _weren't_ released via an _event_. Remember, my entire discussion resolved around hardware keynote events (see my first reply).  > **Me:** Of course. But that‚Äôs not what we‚Äôre taking about here. Those weren‚Äôt released at a keynote event, which is what I was taking about.  This is where I qualify my previous statement (even though it wasn't necessary as I was clearly always referring to keynote events).  > **GoldenJoe24:** No, we‚Äôre talking about spring releases. Are you actually trying to use wordplay to defend a multi-billion dollar corporation online? Very sad.  As we can see, _you_ were talking about spring releases. _I_ was _always_ talking about _hardware_ _keynote_ _events_.  > **Me:** I was always referring to keynote events. Simple as that. No wordplay - I can‚Äôt help if you didn‚Äôt comprehend what I was saying. I‚Äôm not defending Apple at all - that wasn‚Äôt the discussion. I was discussing facts. Not sure what you were discussing.  Again, I was always discussing keynote events, and I never defended Apple (it wasn't part of my argument at all).
