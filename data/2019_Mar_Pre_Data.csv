2,ejbiucx,t3_b564ux,the-velocirapper,"The US changed their clocks a few weeks ago but Europe doesn’t change them until this coming weekend. That means that while Apple events normally start at 19:00 in most of Europe, **today’s event starts at 18:00** and what is written in the OP is incorrect. (Not sure about the rest of the world.)

6,ejbitom,t3_b564ux,cocobandicoot,"Everything I’ve read has said that Tim Cook has been pushing for Apple to become a services company for **years.**  But we’re not just talking about offering a service: rather, Apple is actually producing their own content.   Making their own TV shows and movies is a risky move. It has literally cost the company **BILLIONS** of dollars.  And they’re playable on any ol’ smart tv.  That’s a big shift coming from the company that cares so much about the user experience it makes its own hardware and software. Now you can just get their stuff anywhere, huh?  If this initiative doesn’t pay off, I think it’s safe to say we will see a major leadership change at Apple in the next three or four years.",198,1553490615.0

And Netflix and Disney (etc) are coming out swinging with some seriously heavy exclusives. Plus they haven’t exactly made any big waves in their previously announced shows. I’m fact if they put Oprah on there I’ll skip it on that alone (bringing us the vile plague that is Dr.Oz was bad enough).  It’s a giant, bold, leap away from what they have been good at.

Motion controls in your watch, all the power for AR in your phone, the AR display in whatever form that takes (glasses?) and all the content streamed in real-time over an incredible network. They already allow you to embed AR in browsers.  Then, let's take that one step further. AR movies. Suddenly, Apple have studios, creative control, technology and the user base to roll out AT SCALE AR movies and experiences.   They didn't say 'hey, buy all this kit and you can watch a cool AR movie'. Instead they drip feed this tech over many years. Multiple revisions.

I think originally Netflix wanted to build a collection of every known movie so people could watch by paying a subscription (kinda like they did with their physical mail dvd service).  However the movie industry was terrified by this, and prevents Netflix from getting all the new releases and if they get a new release they typically have to ""trade"" other movies for them.   These new movies also come after the movie is available for sale.   This sadly made it so Netflix is not the best source for movies, iTunes is.  Paying ala-carte on iTunes for rentals is actually the way to go if you want new movies streaming.  Netflix had to change their model and start producing good quality TV series so they could build their service up (so subscribers would not have a reason to leave).  I feel like Apple will be in the same boat unless they can somehow convince the movie industry to do what the music industry did and have all new releases streaming the second they become available to rent.

Apple charges a premium because the products are perceived to be better quality, as well as for the branding. This means that the pricing cannot allow ubiquitous ownership. If everyone out there had AirPods, that image is gone. By moving into services, the goal will be to get Apple devices into as many hands as possible. This means lowering the price. One of Apple's core strengths is their absurd profit margin, and that goes out the window.  As I see it, they can't have both, and they haven't decided which way they'll go. I think, at best, we'll see companion services like Apple Music sprout up. They don't add anything to the mix, but they capitalise on the ecosystem and slowly bleed customers from other services.

556,ejc5o98,t1_ejc5f4i,deleted,i bet Roku is not pleased about that. This doesnt really benefit me in any way since i already have an apple tv and a roku capable smart tv. but im glad to hear they are expanding itunes on the tv beyond the apple tv.  guess im out of the loop,1,1553521144.0

I just would never say I KNOW something about a company if it had yet to be confirmed by them.  Yes, I followed the iPhone events, but I don't put stock in any of the beforehand information unless Apple confirms it.  Perhaps that's just me.",0,1553519568.0

565,ejc6wka,t1_ejc5kx2,russticate,"That's a fair comment to make. I didn't use iTunes match before I signed up for Apple Music because I've got a pretty extensive library and was happy with what I had. Being able to augment that library with anything else I want is a killer feature for me. I'll take it over any music discovery feature, I've discovered music by myself for years without any issue. Apple Music has it's problems for sure, but I feel like they're they only company that gets that there are old fashioned people like me to like to curate instead of just listening to playlists. Not that there is anything wrong with enjoying music that way of course - it's just not for me.",2,1553522129.0
