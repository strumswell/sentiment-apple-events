6,eztzdf1,t3_d2cglb,dysgraphical,Perhaps a bit unrelated but I don't think live chat discussions are the way to go for future Apple Events. The amount of spam was overwhelming and buried any actual discussion going on. The speed that the chat went was so quick that undoubtedly it promoted spam because people knew their spam comments would get buried by other spam. I tried reporting some of it but the chat moved too quickly; quite honestly it's nearly impossible to moderate so I don't blame the mods for it. I'm sure tweaking automod can definitely help but it's going to require a lot more hands on deck to effectively cut on spam. Here's a few examples of what went down:  https://i.imgur.com/IxiLkW8.png  https://i.imgur.com/AZchFwH.png  https://i.imgur.com/7PUP9Bw.png,300,1568142050.0

19,eztzei2,t3_d2cglb,bittuhari,64 GB on the Base model is so underwhelming. Note 10+ Base storage is 256 GB ffs.  I kind of understand them not adding any ground breaking features every year but having 64 GB storage on a Pro model!?   This is Apple not respecting the customer. And the jump from 64 GB to 256 GB just shows the marketing ploy forcing the customers to go with the 256 GB for the extra price. Feels like the 64 GB is only there so that they can advertise the iPhone is starting under 1000 bucks.,747,1568142070.0

When the lady introducing the iPhone 11 (not Pro), not sure of her name, and the guy was introducing the Apple Watch, I was confused as neither of them were recognizable faces. I'm used to Kevin Lynch for Apple Watch and Phil for iPhone. I was hoping that it would end and they'd pull a ""one more thing"" and introduce the new, really heavy hitting features. I was hoping for Sleep tracking in Watch (I still think this might come as a software update), blood pressure monitoring on the Watch, and at least something other than a new camera for the iPhone. Perhaps reverse charging (let me charge my Watch!!), in screen fingerprint scanner, 5G readiness. Such a stupid thing to think of, but I was confused at first where the big names were until Phil came out and introduced the Pro.  I was going to upgrade to the newest phones this year but I think I might hold out until next year.

Nice that the cheap iPad has pencil support now but the A10 chip is laughable. It’s good enough now, but will it have a long life before it starts to really fall behind?

They skimmed over a lot of features that I would have preferred to hear more about on the devices. Did I miss where they announced release dates for iOS 13 and iPad OS? I know it is at the end of September from the news now, but don't recall seeing it in the keynote.  My thoughts on each announcement:  * Arcade and Apple TV+ feels like such meh ideas that probably won't pan out.     * Arcade I have 0 interest in. I don't play a lot of mobile titles. Unless someone comes out with a nice RPG style game that I can get into and plays well on the phone with nice screen controls, I won't really ever be into mobile gaming.    * Apple TV+ I am a little interested in. I want to see what movies/shows that aren't originals that will be included for the $5 a month.  * Apple Watch 5 is a nice update I guess with always on display. Still wish battery life could be extended more than 18 hours though. * New ""cheap"" iPad I felt really didn't need to be presented. Seemed like such small updates to it. Sure it has a bigger screen and better chip, but just was another meh. * iPhone 11 - A little pissed at the $50 price reduction since I bought an XR last year, but overall feel like it is a decent change. $699 still is a lot of money, but $749 felt like such an odd price point. Cameras look like they do a great job...will they stack up to the Pixel 3 is what remains to be seen. Honestly, looks like only an update to CPU/Camera over XR. I won't be upgrading anytime soon. Colors are neat. I do like the light green one. * iPhone 11 Pro - For a ""Pro"" device, it really doesn't feel like a fully pro device. A few things are what I believe bring the phone down in terms of it not being pro-enough for me: having the same CPU as non-pro version, no USB-C and still starting at 64GB storage. But hey, it finally comes with a fast charger in the box right?  * Price reductions for iPhone 8: Should be $399 instead of $449 starting price.

They won't look at it as much as a iPhone cheaper version and the normal version. Now it will have some feeling like the normal version and the high end version  Battery life claims seem impressive and much needed.  Cameras are obviously the biggest focus. I'm curious to see how they perform. I think in this day and age pictures are big and people are no longer carrying dedicated cameras or spending on DSLRs as much unless they are pros   Other than that, I could see how some can be disappointed.

242,ezv78k8,t3_d2cglb,superchunked,"IDK if this deserves its own thread or just in r/unpopularopinion so I decided to just post it here instead.  This was an absolutely meh show in every aspect. Let's start with a baseline. In January 2019 I moved from an Pixel 3 plus Huawai watch to an iPhone Xs and Watch Series 4 w/ cellular. (reasons = watch and meh pixel hardware quality)  Now let's look at each ""innovation"" device shown today.  1. ""New"" iPad. This is literally the same pad with a larger screen that now supports more accessories. That's it. I wanted to buy a new iPad and since my wife owns a iPad Pro 11, I know that all I need is the entry device for my needs so I thought I'd wait to see the newest variant. Well, I just bought the previous version for $250 on Amazon. I love Apple's marketing to make it seem like there is so much new in this device. There isn't. Literally the same hardware, same cpu(s), same pencil support, same functionality, etc. Just a bigger screen. This one is 20% faster than a certain PC? Well, since its the same CPU then so is the 6th gen version. Should've put in a newer CPU at the very least. I recommend that if you're considering a new entry level iPad, better hurry up and get a deal on the 6th gen before gone otherwise you're wasting $80. 2. Watch Series 5. Simply put there is a reason they discontinued the series 4 similar to the iPhone X last year. The only actual differences are always on display (I thought I could do this already, but I was confusing that with my old watch) and a built-in compass. Apps are all part of WatchOS6 which will come to my series 4 too. Since 4 was, IMO, a big upgrade from all before, it I guess if you don't have 4 then this is worth the upgrade. 3. iPhone 11/Pro. Cameras. That's about it and also why they discontinued the Xs. Sure you can cite the better glass and waterproofing but really that is nominal improvements. However, I am very interested in the dark mode since that is so much like Google's Night Shot from last year and the last feature I miss from my Pixel3 (with 1 camera). Honestly, I'm more interested in the variety of colors including the forest green in the Pro. Anyone with an iPhone 8 or older, may consider upgrading I guess. But, I would probably still go get an Xs at discount before the 11 pro. I wouldn't consider the other versions as OLED is much better than LCD. IDK, I guess if I can get $850-900 for my Xs I'd pay the extra $100+ for a 11Pro just for the night mode.  Really what it comes down to is that the actual tech is in a bit of a plateau causing moderate YoY improvements. I am surprised at the folks clapping in-house when they stated this device has X feature that was a feature already on the current year models.   Feel free to press on me the significant features I'm missing that are not just tied to OS upgrades that the 2018 models are already getting too.",3,1568169036.0

377,ezuf44b,t3_d2cglb,Aragorn527,"Unpopular opinion(s)   - I think the price points of AppleTV+ and Apple Arcade are really good (especially since you get 1 year free for buying a product).   - My sister is an artist in her free time and doesn’t really use her 13” MacBook, but likes the screen size better than her 9” iPad. I think the fact that the iPad is getting its own OS AND a size up is a really good thing for those who want to use just an iPad.   - iPhone 11 is pretty cool. Not amazing or groundbreaking, so I’ll be holding onto my X for another year. That said, I know a lot of people who are into photography/movie making but aren’t willing to really dive in... using an iPhone with those built in tools is actually pretty amazing.   Overall - not terribly exciting but better than last year. I think people in this thread forget how negatively received the XR and XS initially were.",1,1568150968.0
378,ezuh7ua,t3_d2cglb,mxtzo,"IMHO all three of the new iPhones look hideous from the back. The way they decided to arrange the cameras in individual circles instead of one huge unit (i.e. dual camera system on 7+, 8+, X, XS) looks horrible to my eyes. Maybe this is a sign of Jony Ive not even trying anymore?  They look like last year's phones (and the X from two years ago) from the front. By now the notch looks outdated and played out.   The 11 has the same sub-1080p LCD display while Android phones in the same price bracket have at least 1080p and even 1440p OLED displays. They lowered the price by $50, but it should have been more like $599-649 as is, or at least include a 1080p OLED panel for the current price.  All three iPhones still start at 64GB whereas most other phones in competing price brackets have at least 128GB. At least they have the courage to throw in the fast charger in the box for once and support external drives!  The disappointing hardware and focus on services indicates that Apple is slowly transitioning into a services company.  They did one thing that I wasn't expecting (10.2-inch iPad) and didn't do one thing that I was expecting (16-inch MacBook Pro). Given that the Mac section of the Apple store went down today, I was crossing my fingers, but it didn't happen.  If this wasn't Apple, I'd predict that these phones would be a huge flop. But since it is Apple, only time will tell...",1,1568152190.0

1083,ezu7fco,t1_ezu0s7c,HeterosexualMail,"reddit is getting brutal to use. The only place I use new reddit is on mobile. They've been launching changes there recently, and the result of those is now that there is a persistent 'Use App' button in the header, a chat button I'm likewise completely uninterested in, and on every page I load I now get two popups requiring me to confirm I want to load the content in my browser. Newly added is now when I actually want to view more than the first three top level comments in a discussion, I need to click another button to load all the comments instead of scrolling down to different content. So I need to click three times just to use a page of reddit that I used to have to click zero times.  Collapsing comments is broken, taking me to a page I didn't intend to visit far too often.  The new header has also removed the ability to toggle a dropdown and input the subreddit I want to visit. I'm close to giving up on the mobile website, the end result of which would be that I'll visit reddit maybe twice a day, instead of several times throughout.  On top of all this, on desktop the opt out for the new design no longer works, so I have to make sure I'm hitting old.reddit.com now instead of having the preference take care of things. This means that shared internal links that almost always use www turn into another annoyance. Previously that was only an issue when I was logged out, but now it's constant.

USB-C instead of lightening to standardize things, USB-C is the future and Apple see's that on all of there other devices except for cheap iPad and iPhone.  A design refresh could have been nice as well. And not that 5G is required, but for a $1000 phone, it should have been there.
