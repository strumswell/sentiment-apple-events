It‚Äôs like Christmas morning!  -------  Edit: For me (and many others, I'm sure) it started with the iPod days. My older cousins had the early generation iPods, and they just seemed magical. My first was an iPod Video 32GB (later named the Classic). I loved that thing to death and filled it to the brim with music and episodes of The Office. Then I got an iPod Touch some years later, which was again a magical time for mobile tech. Shortly after, it was my first MacBook Pro for school, and then an iPhone a few years later. Then I was a day-1 Apple Watch pre-orderer, another product I think they've nailed way better than anyone else.   I am one of the first people to criticize Apple when they deserve it (as my post history shows), but I still love their products overall. I still use Windows and Google products every day, but they can't beat the ""magic"" of Apple. I want it to continue to be a company that focuses on extremely good products that trade quality over quantity, even if that means high prices.",214,1568081513.0

689,eztc9ik,t1_ezsirhy,karmapopsicle,"It‚Äôs about time for the entry iPad to get its refresh anyway. One of the biggest reasons I could think to go laminated would be to encourage much greater Apple Pencil adoption, but if they gave it the display and magnetic attachment for the Pencil like on the Pro we‚Äôd see a ton of cannibalized sales there.   From the perspective of a commercial customer like me though, I would absolutely love to see the return of the laminated display to the base model. When I switched to an iPad-based POS retail solution last year I ended up buying a handful of refurb iPad Air 2s on Amazon for the laminated screen instead of 6th gen iPads. On a side note, the Air 2 is possibly one of the best examples of how gracefully an exceptionally designed product can age - launches nearly 5 years ago with iOS 8 yet still remains perfectly snappy and usable even with the iPadOS Beta. I can imagine many small businesses are in the same situation, where it‚Äôs still just a better deal to buy refurb Air 2s for the display rather than the noticeable downgrade to a more expensive new 6th gen or spending nearly 3x more for a new Air.  Weren‚Äôt there some rumblings about the iPhones getting some much needed ruggedness improvements? Perhaps the slight display bump will go hand in hand with a larger body and more resilient construction. That would definitely be something quite appealing to education customers.",1,1568126874.0
