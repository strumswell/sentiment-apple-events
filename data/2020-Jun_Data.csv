3100,fvnj6p7,t3_hdw3dw,lignarius1,"Since we're talking about Apple transitioning one or more of its Mac lines from Intel to its own in-house ARM platform, let's take a look at previous major transitions Apple has made between hardware and software platforms.  Motorola 68k to PowerPC: Apple started work in 1992 and released the first Power Mac in 1994. Only some parts of System 7 were written for PowerPC; the rest was emulated. This transition was never fully complete and ended when Apple released Mac OS X in 2001, which was fully native for PowerPC, and sunsetted Mac OS 9.2 in 2002.  Classic Mac OS to Mac OS X: As above, Apple had rewritten parts of Classic Mac OS for PowerPC over time but the was inherently poor and lacked modern features. Mac OS X provided cutting-edge technology and allowed running most Classic Mac OS apps in a sandboxed environment. For developers, Apple offered Carbon, a cleaned-up version of the Classic Mac OS API that ran natively on Mac OS X and took less effort to develope existing Classic Mac OS apps for than migrating to Cocoa.  32-bit PowerPC to 64-bit PowerPC: Apple had 64-bit PowerPC hardware thanks to the PowerPC 970, which was derived from IBM's POWER4 architecture. Mac OS X 10.3 through Mac OS X 10.5 allowed access to 64-bit performance in some cases, but were not themselves fully 64-bit operating systems. Otherwise, everything ""just worked"" with minimal fuss.  32 & 64-bit PowerPC to 32 & 64-bit Intel: Mac OS X 10.4 was the first publicly-released version of Apple's modern operating system that supported two processor architectures, PowerPC and Intel, and 32 and 64-bit variants of each (though Mac OS X was rumored to have been running on Intel since its inception). Apps written for Mac OS X's native API, called Cocoa at the time, could be recompiled to support Intel with minimal effort but Carbon apps were run in a low-level, invisible PowerPC-to-Intel emulation layer called Rosetta.  64-bit Intel to 64-bit Apple ARMv8.x: This is what we're looking at today, according to rumors. As with the transition from PowerPC to Intel, it's like Apple has been internally running macOS on its A-series processors since the Apple A8, its first 64-bit ARM platform. Rumors of a ""Rosetta II"" debuting alongside macOS (10.)16 are afloat, implying another comfortable transition between hardware architectures for end-users.",1,1592845196.0

Average at best. They could do so much more.   iOS 14 looks incredibly lacklustre, I wonder if they had to cut features due to Covid, iPadOS the same, when the fact that a phone call notification change makes it into a presentation of almost two hours you know they are scraping the barrel. For any other software company this comes out in an incredibly small point upgrade, for modern day Apple it’s a massive new feature in a keynote.  That being said.... MacOS hasn’t has suffered from lack of love lately and not had much updates and suffered from the same lack of attention I’ve already mentioned the most, but it looks like they have actually done stuff with it this year and while not ground breaking the new UI etc makes it look decent and seems at least they actually did something and seems a worthwhile upgrade.  The work on moving to the apple processors looks decent too. It’s just a bit of a shame personally as I own an intel iMac and while it’s almost 5 years old it rocks a 4ghz i7 and upgraded GPU so I’m planning on keeping it for some time to come. My concern will be Apple dropping compatibility within a few years for this model and I’m not sure i want to drop another 2 and a half grand on a machine yet. I was hoping to get a decent life out of it as it still runs everything perfectly.  Also the Keynote format was awful and one of the most cringe things i have ever seen.",-10,1592852318.0

I think this kinda thing though just introduces the possibly of that being a bit more limited though.  Say in two years time, two OS releases away when there line up is perhaps almost all Apple chips, are they still going to support a 7 year old Mac with an OS update? Even though it’s perfectly fine? And then if they don’t suddenly your apps stop working etc cause you can’t update those etc and then the resale value drops massively too as the machine becomes more useless.   Maybe I need to consider a Mac mini or something next time, hopefully with this switch they will bring out better updated ones. Cause I guess a big part of the cost is losing the screen as well.

Would Rosetta 2 allow windows to run on Parallels? Because it’s not the binary that needs to be translated and it’s normally not really emulating the x86_64 platform. It also usually doesn’t really have to do any JIT compiling because the VM’s OS’s arch used to match that of the hypervisor. If I understand correctly that means that parallels wouldn’t work out of the box on arm based platforms because Parallels assumes that the client OS should just be able to run through the VTx instructions. Although maybe that triggers something in Rosetta 2 to handle the emulation for Parallels without the hypervisor having to do anything.
