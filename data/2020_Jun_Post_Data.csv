11,fvnxgnh,t3_hdyaeh,splxx,I enjoyed this COVID-friendly format. The transitions and other production work was real slick and entertaining. The conference of course lost that “cult-like” atmosphere with the lack of applause at every sentence. I feel like the last few conferences have been pretty good with the exception of the TV one they did last year.  I guess we will have to wait for over the ear headphones.

14,fvnylxg,t3_hdyaeh,hammerheadtiger,"It was easy to guess that Apple would be doing a prerecorded WWDC. But in my wildest dreams I did not expect this level of production and polish. I think them being able to tightly control pacing for things like demos and speakers made even the 'boring' parts great to watch. And the transitions are gorgeous, hats off to the video team.  Impressions:  * iOS and iPadOS: Lots of stuff people have been asking for. Out of the way Siri, call notifications, PIP on iPhone FINALLY. Welcome stuff. Edit: ALSO DEFAULT APPS. They pulled a sneaky and hid it in the slides of extra stuff. * macOS: Some might not like the iOS-ification of the system, but as someone who grew up on an iPad, using a mac has always felt weird. Like I would need to fight the OS a bit to do what I expect it to do. I am glad to see the new control center. The bit about the layered translucency is giving me iOS 7 war flashbacks. * ARM on Macs. I am impressed they did all that with an iPad CPU. Obviously some intense active cooling going on, but impressive nonetheless. I get the feeling that they are holding their hardware cards close to their vest. We'll probably see a real purpose built Apple Mac CPU close to launch. I expect that they'll have performance numbers to shock and awe us when they do. Otherwise, it certainly seems true that Apple wishes to make this as boring of a transition as possible for the end user. Emulation, virtualization, and a dev kit. Neat and tidy. * Foundation TV. Looks good. Still think Apple needs to try a little harder on content if they're going to have Apple TV not just be the thing people occasionally go to to watch a specific show. * WatchOS: Once again, Kevin crossing off a feature from the ""list of things people want"" with sleep tracking. I cant wait to have definitive metrics showing me how I don't wash my hands long enough. Also it is weirdly funny that it uses context clues like hand movements and soap sounds to figure out if you are washing your hands. Like, a group of people had to sit down and whiteboard how to program this feature and someone wrote 'soap sounds' and circled it and everyone in the room noded in appreciation. * Spacial Audio on AirPods Pro sounds really interesting, Seems like one of those things where once you have it, you don't want to go back. * Also they might as well just announce AirTags 2 Pro w/ wireless charging in September since they've waited so long already.",215,1592852797.0

18,fvny25f,t3_hdyaeh,tekreviews,"Widget customization, picture-in-picture, translate, universal search, and non-full screen calls and siri (and better siri)... it's like Apple is actually listening to us... As both an XR and OP7 Pro user myself, I would even go as far as to say that the widgets looks better implemented on iOS.  With iOS 14, it's really hard for me to justify getting anything other than an iPhone now given the much better software experience/support, privacy, ecosystem, longevity/resale value, and app quality/filtering (unless there's a hardware feature it doesn't have). The only things they need to add now ~~are default apps and~~  (nvm they added that too!) is themes.  Other features I thought were amazing were: Apple pencil features, automatic switching on Airpods, spacial audio, new location sharing/tracking/data privacy, and of course...

Big Sur is going to look weird on my macbook but i'm down for it I guess. Skipped Catalina but i'll jump into this.  As far as presentation goes, I think they (and most other tech companies) should always do it like this. Not having a crowd robbed them of the opportunity to do cringy shit, force nervous nerds to speak in public, or bring out pop stars that have nothing to do with anything. And it turned out great.

35,fvo0s79,t3_hdyaeh,-protonsandneutrons-,"For everyone ""worried"" how ARM performs with multiple cores, here's a [**nice Anandtech review from Amazon's newest ARM-based CPUs**](https://www.anandtech.com/show/15578/cloud-clash-amazon-graviton2-arm-against-intel-and-amd), the Graviton2: 64-core ARM (Neoverse N1) vs 64-core Intel (Cascade Lake) vs 64-core AMD (Naples). The Rome, EPYC2, isn't yet on Amazon's ""rent a server"" catalog.  TL;DR: ARM scales like a fucking ***rocket*** with multiple cores and beats x86 in nearly every benchmark. Single-core performance was the ARM bottleneck (e.g., Qualcomm has publicly struggled with their ARM-based CPUs); because Apple has made huge PPC (performance-per-core) strides, you've got the ***best*** of both worlds.  For those confused with the terminology:  x86 = **Intel** (all), **AMD** (all)  ARM = **Apple** Silicon, **Qualcomm** Snapdragon, **Amazon** Graviton, etc.  x86 & ARM are essentially the languages used by the processor. Each processor line-up runs just ***one*** language natively.",14,1592853862.0
36,fvnz74i,t3_hdyaeh,InvaderDJ,"Doing this prerecorded was so much better. Much less awkward and higher quality. I know they enjoy getting Apple employees in an auditorium so they can applaud their work, but this felt like a much better presentation style.   The iOS updates sound great, if App Library works like it sounds, this may be the app drawer I’ve wanted for iOS since iOS 3.0 and the iPhone 3G. Finally can have a home screen that isn’t cluttered with apps so I can finally see my wallpaper. Default apps for web and email is great too, although if they were cool they would have done the same thing for maps too.   ARM Macs are interesting. I remain excited but skeptical.

The the background for all three icons had more of a “blueprint”/“beta” texture to it, so it may not be final. From memory an icon did completely change design from when it was first showcased to when it was publicly released. The icons shadows are weird too. I wouldn’t even mind if the iOS icons were brought over (I thought that’s what they’ve been *trying* to do anyway; unify macOS, iOS, and iPadOS so going from one to another isn’t so different?).",8,1592852253.0

Especially now considering how iOS-y MacOS looks.   7/10  MacOS 11:   I like some of the design choices, but the icons are not to my liking. The UI looks ok, but I‘m not a big fan of the white everywhere, maybe with dark mode it will look better. It’s nice to see that extensions are returning. Generally there isn’t that much in this update. Hopefully stability will improve. Also it‘s not called Sequoia, which pisses me off.   6/10 ?  arm Macs:  Really depends on how well they perform and if Rosetta 2 is any good. Can‘t really rate it.   ?/10  Home + TVOS:   Finally the Homepod supports 3rd Party music providers. Finally there is more standardisation for home equipment. TVOS seems somewhat forgotten?   8/10  WatchOS 7:   Sleep tracking is great. Better workout choices is great. The lack of 3rd party watch faces is disappointing though. It‘s a minor update.

I don't need this big window taking up a ton of space. The way it works now is fine. -	For Messages and Groups, is it at all possible to finally leave group chats with less than 4 people? I'm currently stuck in a 3 person group chat (myself included) and the ""Leave this conversation"" bar is greyed out. Apparently iOS requires 4 people in a group chat in order for someone to leave it. -	So for App Clips, I wouldn't need the whole App? So if someone sends me an Instagram post and I don't have the Instagram app, I can download the App Clip and essentially view it without needing to have the Instagram app and even a Instagram account? -	9to5Mac is saying with iOS 14 you can now set default email and browser apps. Is that actually true? -	9to5 is also saying the UI screen for calls is now changed to a new notification banner. Is that actually true?  For macOS Big Sur:  -	Is the translucent menu bar going to the default design? I think it's fine currently.

I view it as a proof of concept and that the tech exists and works. I would be very surprised if that iPad processor turned in anything but the lowest end Macs, and even then only because of economies of scale. Having said that, loads of tech websites have benchmarked the iPad Pro and iPhone 11 Pro and cannot really peg the processor in a many meaningful way. It makes me think there’s a *lot* of untapped performance there and maybe that’s because the processors are the ones that have been leading a double life? Ostensibly designed for iOS devices, what if they’re not the highly focused silicon we’ve been led to believe but rather they’re more general usage in terms of Apple’s roadmap?  The game was an interesting one, because it wasn’t native - it was being translated via the new Rosetta 2 tech (caveat, the game was already in Metal which means it was already halfway there in terms of GPU calls).

No mention of a special mac specific SoCs in the future (they really need a higher power “m” line so their pro products don’t get left in the dust with a mobile processor).  They were showing a proof of concept using the A12Z iPad SoC. They mentioned in both the keynote and state of the union that they are developing “a family of processors” for the Mac line that will ostensibly be much beefier than the current mobile chips (higher clocks, higher TDP, bigger caches, more/wider external IO, etc).

The home screen design isn't as important, but I really like how they made it more Android-esque, as aggreably as they said, current iOS home screens are a bit cluttered and come with lower ability to hide apps you don't use on a regular basis. My Android phone screen includes maybe 10 apps at most, while the entire library is closed to 8 pages. I much prefer this and what they did with widgets. I think they even beat Android on those.   And it's a whole bunch of little annoyances why I wouldn't mode before, like no ability to change default web Browser or email if I wanted. I'd likely use safari, but probably Gmail for my email as it has things like schedule send I use all the time. I couldn't do this till now.

842,fvojvif,t1_fvo8mm4,onan,"On a big scale, the absolute best things would have been spinning the Mac off into a completely separate company, or re-starting MacOS licensing to third party system makers.   The former would completely free mac hardware and software from being the afterthought stepchild of a phone company, and the latter would at least do so for the hardware.  On a smaller scale:  - There is a huge class of security problems that are really UX problems. Adding more tools to allow users to genuinely understand what their systems are doing, without being so spammy that people just become desensitized to clicking ""permit,"" is a big challenge that apple _should_ be able to tackle unusually well.  - A good first step in the above would be buying Little Snitch and integrating it more smoothly into the platform.  - Speaking of things apple _should_ have been able to do better than anyone else: VR. This is the next thing that is going to change the world as much as the internet did, and given that it is both a hardware problem and a software problem, apple should have been at the front of that parade. Unfortunately, I think they are 5+ years too late at this point, and the world has already left them behind.  - Another step which would have been world-changing but is probably too late: apple would have been the only company in the world to be able to make email actually secure. PGP has existed for decades, it just has never had broad adoption and key distribution infrastructure. Apple could have offered that, and in the process forced other MTAs and MUAs to do so. Given how frequently email now represents the final form of authentication for services, it's difficult to convey how huge the benefit of this would be for everyone in the world who uses any service on any site.  - APFS actually journaling file contents, not just filesystem metadata.  On and even smaller and more specific scale, I would like them to un-break all the things they have broken and functionality they have removed from macos in the post-iphone era:  - All of the functionality from Exposé and Spaces returned that they gutted when they mashed them together into Mission Control.  - Fullscreening that does not automatically create a new ephemeral desktop that can't be navigated to in the same ways as the others.  - Fullscreening only when actually requested, not any time the zoom button is used.  - Nvidia driver support.  - Mail recovering its ability to display plaintext messages, not just html.  - A return of the ability for users to do system-wide theming, so we don't have to all wait with bated breath on apple to release a mediocre dark mode themselves.  - Or if they're going to insist on being the only ones who can actually do it, make dark mode _actually_ dark mode. Not just menubars and window decorations, but all document, email, and web browser content as well.  - Subpixel antialiasing that works with BGR or pentile displays, not just RGB.  - Safari recovering an option for discrete url and search fields.  - As combined with the security/UX issues above, finding a way to make full-powered browser extensions safer, rather than just disabling them categorically.  And probably a million more things, this is a short list off the top of my head.

I can have an app drawer like Android, I can have widgets on my home screen, I have a custom theme, and much more. The uniformity of iPhone hardware means individual developers can make tweaks that work for 95% of all iPhones, whereas with Android developers need to create modifications for a specific year of a specific model of a specific brand.
