74,gbv9ozv,t3_jrqtg2,akarypid,"So, the M1 is a UMA chip. **For those who don't know this means the memory is** **SHARED** **between the CPU and GPU which access data in-place concurrently**. And by that I don't mean that GPU and CPU each get a separate chunk of it, but that they can operate on the data in-place at the same time!  This is a cool thing which AMD sought to establish for a long time, but simply didn't have the weight to build the ecosystem. Nice to see Apple putting its muscle behind it. A lot of optimizations to graphics applications can come of this.  Good news is that M1 memory is likely some form of HBM or something similar, which means you also get computational performance increase on even non-graphics workloads due to do improved memory access by the CPU (or even due to the lack of the need to transfer data at all as mentioned earlier).  **Bad news is that it is still SHARED**: you pro mac which had a discrete AMD GPU also had discrete VRAM - if you had 16GB RAM and 4GB VRAM those were separate and loading 3GB of graphics assets to GPU memory left system memory free. Not any more. If you go for the 8GB ""pro"" and need 2GB worth of VRAM assets, that leaves 6GB for applications (and yes the CPU can also directly access those parts to work on graphics data in-place but that memory is still allocated to that data).  I'm writing this because if you're looking at the ""pro"" model for any sort of 3D work, you'd best keep that in mind. The 16GB option is a must if you do any sort of remotely serious graphics work on the mac. So don't get carried away by the ""up to X times faster"" commercials. That's only if your workload fits in memory. Once it stops fitting in RAM, the ""up to"" becomes the key word in that expression.  For most users doing web browsing, watching streaming services and some office work, even an 8GB Air should be enough (heck you could just get the iPad Pro). The 16GB Air is a tougher sell but still reasonable. 8GB Pro makes absolutely no sense to me, I'd go for the 16GB Pro instead.  I'm looking forward to seeing optimized application benchmarks for M1. You can get nice optimizations from UMA.  *On another note: I see they didn't announce the 16-inch update.* I don't know if there's any chance, but I'm also really looking forward to an AMD SoC with UMA. They've long been held back by lack of the software ecosystem and Intel pushing against it (because they didn't have graphics) but now AMD has some $$$ and Intel's ""partners"" need something to compete with M1 which Intel cannot provide. An AMD SoC at 5nm using RDNA2 and HBM will be an absolute performance killer (even for M1). I'm not sure they'd use that in a 16-inch Macbook Pros (they likely have an M1X or something in the works), but we can hope to see it push the bar in a Surface Book maybe?",11,1605042589.0

This is a Mac focused event and short. Impressions:  &#x200B;  1. Apple Park: One really great thing about this new format is getting to see Apple Park up close. I had expected that the campus would forever be shrouded in secrecy but here we are with HD drone shots of the interior. Did you know those chairs in the cafeteria cost $2,500? 2. M1 CPU: 5 nm SOC with 16 billion transistors. The performance is insane. It is interesting that they are only introducing 1 CPU and just adding cooling and more watts to boost performance. This reminds me of the 2018 MBA that was only offered in i5. It never seemed really Apple-like to ask consumers to 'just pick the right i3/i5/i7 for your needs.' Now the choice is just really just between Air and Pro. I wonder if average selling price will fall now that people are settling for M1 base model (Or even buying the Air). 3. Intel CEO Bob Swan: In a corner of his office in fetal position 4. Macbook Air: Fanless and faster than the previous model with 6 more hours of battery life. Nearly every spec is improved in some significant way. This is probably one of the most solid upgrades to the MacBook air ever. It's also unsurprising as the current gen MacBook Airs are borderline fanless already. Macbook 12 inch fans should be very happy at this news. I just looked online: Only 2 models this time and the cheaper one has a nerfed GPU, interesting thing to not bring up at all during the event. 5. Mac Mini: $100 cheaper. Apple is really hammering in the price performance story this time. I'm curious if Apple has basically shifted to 1 CPU option for these models. (Update: they kept 1 single sad Intel option) 6. MacBook Pro: I like how in the introduction video they specifically show the esc button like ""Here it is, everyone get a good look at it so we don't get dragged again."" The battery life improvements here is insane as well 10 hours more wow. I just checked and they have replaced the regular models with M1 and are keeping the expensive i5 models, it'll be interesting to see the performance comparison 7. Other Macs: It makes sense that there can't be one single CPU for the MBA all the way through the Mac Pro. I expect Mac Pro to be one of the last Macs to get the upgrade. 8. They ended this the best way they could have possibly done so with the PC guy. Great callback. 9. AirTags: For a product that is designed to help find things they sure are lost.

250,gbuu4y8,t3_jrqtg2,Destroya12,"My takeaway thoughts in no particular order  1. It seems from the videos that they are not using the butterfly keyboard on the new Macbooks. I'm not sure if it was explicitly confirmed yet, but it certainly looked that way. Good news IMO. 2. They said that Big Sur and Apple Silicon will be able to use iOS apps, but realistically it will require devs to remake them for the Mac, right? Like it's not like Day 1 you can download every app you can for your iPhone, right? The conference just said that porting over apps is easy, which is good for long term prospects, but you just know there are apps that will be abandoned and not ported over. So which ones won't be? Impossible to say now, but a key consideration for new Macbook buyers. 3. Why is there no Pro Motion on the Macbook Pro? I get why they don't do it on the Air, but come on they went out there and explicitly said how smooth animations are now, why not make the most of it with a 120hz refresh rate display on the MacBook Pro? Between this and iPhone Pros not getting it this year I'm starting to wish they hadn't introduced it in the iPad Pros and set the expectation in the first place. They're just teasing us. 4. FUCKING FINALLY they focused on making the webcams better. I'll need to see some sort of actual testing, but just the fact that they mentioned it at all after how many years is a plus. 5. Battery life, enough said. Will be very interesting to see how they compete with the Dell XPS line 6. Why no mention of LTE support? I know the M1 isn't the same as the A14, but since you're making your own chips, surely Apple can now design Macbook Models that have cellular connectivity in them, much like they do with the iPads and Apple Watches. Why not do that right out of the gate as an option to show just how cool Apple Silicon is? Like have a cheaper wifi only model and one with wifi+cellular. As far as 95% of the market is concerned laptops are now only wifi anyway so it would be a truly new experience for most even if Apple wouldn't be the first to the market with it. 7. Pricing. Apple isn't paying Intel licensing fees anymore. They clearly didn't put much R&D into re-engineering the chassis for these MacBooks because they're the same as last years. Aside from M1, they didn't seem to pack them with any new tech at all. So why are they not cheaper to boot? I'm not saying a massive price reduction, $100 at most? If they can do it with the Mac Mini, why not the MacBooks too? 8. Why is the M1 not called the M14? It's based on the same architecture, isn't it? Keep the naming scheme the same, make it clearer to consumers going forward which Mac chip is aligned with which iPhone. Same way that Samsung went straight from the Note 5 to the Note 7 to keep their Note/S lines on the same number, it would be nice if Apple could do the same. Sure it's easy for people to distinguish them now, but what happens in 5 years, when there's been an M2, M3, M4 and M5, along side an A15, A16, A17, and A18, and models from previous years are still sold in stores? It will be confusing which product came out in which year. And if Apple does something with the 16"" MBP or their iMac line (like say an MX chip) it will only make it even more confusing. 1 number for all their chips in a given year. If they can't do that, name the chip after the year, ie 2020 M chip, 2021 A Chip, 2022 AX chip, etc.",2,1605035154.0

Two hours longer battery life, better microphones and a slightly brighter display? How are they pro features?

And why are the top and bottom display bezels still so wide and disproportionately thicker than the side ones? It's not like they increased the webcam quality either.

You can't justify a ""pro"" characterization when you only have 8GB shared across both (!) the CPU and GPU. If you do any sort of 3D work that's just too little memory. IMHO, people should definitely steer clear of that flavor, or at least wait for benchmarks on real-life workloads. I doubt it will be that competitive excep when memory usage requirements are in fact low and fit into the 8GB envelope.",1,1605043405.0

Now that Radeon is expected to perform similarly to, if not sometimes better than NVIDIA RTX 3000 series (Ampere cards) at most pricepoints, there is little reason not to go for it. Sure, we need to see the benchmarks first, but it's exciting what new possibilities these cards will unlock with more accessible/sane pricing than NVIDIA (especially when looking at RX 6900XT vs RTX 3090).

2231,gbv86vx,t1_gbuvb5e,GODZiGGA,"> Does having more or less wattage available not allow them to run the chip faster/slower?  I'm trying to think of a simple way to answer this but there isn't really a way to do that. It's a good question, but because ARM chips are designed and operate in such a radically different way than a traditional x64 CPU, they don't really use power scaling in the same way. Like, yes if you increase wattage available to a generic/hypothetical ARM SoC, you also theoretically are able to improve performance compared to an ARM SoC that was designed for a lower available wattage. However, if you were to take a specific ARM SoC, such as the M1 and simply increase wattage available to the chipset, you wouldn't necessarily get an increase in performance the same way you would expect to get from a traditional x64 CPU. This is partly due to the way ARM SoCs are designed.  First, most of the time, ARM chips are designed as a multi processor system-on-a-chip (MPSoC or SoC). In a traditional computer, the CPU is a dedicated processor (although many times it does have an integrated GPU), the rest of the chipset is found in a compatible motherboard which will have chips/controllers for I/O (USB, networking, etc.), memory, etc. You can use an AMD CPU with an Intel LAN/WiFi controller, Micron RAM, and an Nvidia GPU if you had the ability to create the motherboard yourself. On an SoC, the CPU, GPU, I/O, and memory is all combined into a single chip. So everything needed to run the computer is self-contained inside the chip. This is why you can get decent performance from a computer that can fit inside an Altoids container like a Raspberry Pi. A Mac Mini isn't huge, but it is bigger than an Altoids tin because the Mac Mini has (or rather had) it's chipset spread across a motherboard which requires more space.  If we were to compare an 8-core Intel CPU to the CPU portion of 8-core ARM SoC, the biggest difference between the two is the design of the cores.   The Intel CPU has 8 identical cores that perform the same tasks, use the same amount of power, and have equal performance at different power targets. If you want to increase performance so you increase wattage to the CPU which allows you to increase clock speed. You want to decrease performance to save battery or lower thermals and you lower wattage to the CPU and need to lower clock speed.  On the other hand, the ARM CPU is setup in a big.LITTLE configuration; 4 cores being ""little"" and 4 core being ""big"". Little cores are slower and use little power (even at peak use) and the big cores are fast and use more power (and can also use power scaling to modulate clock). Rather than using power scaling alone, like the Intel CPU, the ARM CPU varies it's CPU grouping hsage based on current demand. If performance is needed the workload switches from little to big. If big is being used at minimum power targets, the workload will move from big to little. It would be like have both a high performance gas engine and a super effecient electric motor in a single car; when you are putzing along a city street at 30 MPH, the electric engine is amazing and saves gas, but if you turn onto a race track for a few laps, you have a high performance, inefficient gas engine to help you win the race.  The downside to the big.LITTLE configuration is it is inflexible. A specific chipset is designed for specific power/clock combinations. If you want to use different power/clock combinations, you need to create a different chipset.  Since Apple is releasing a single SoC and not differentiating between the 8 CPU core/8 GPU core M1 in the MBP/MBA, it is safe to assume they are identical in their power/clock design requirements. The base 8 CPU core/7 GPU core chipset on the MBA is likely due to silicon yields on the SoC, there is likely a production yield issue (currently) where they are unable to produce an 8 GPU SoC a certain percentage of the time and rather than recycling the ""defects"" they can release them as a lower option for the MBA. As effciency increases, they will likely end up needing to intentionally disable a GPU core before using it in the base MBA (this is common and not a shady practice).  If Apple was specifying that the 8 GPU core MBA was using the M1a SoC and the MBP was using the M1p SoC, then we could assume that there were different power/clock domains being used for each SoC and that the MBP was able to use more wattage to increase performance, but I don't think that is likely due to the information that was released and is available on their website at this time.   Obviously we will know more when 3rd parties get their hands on units for reviews and teardowns.",14,1605041855.0

Regardless, we'll have to wait for benchmarks and reviews to see what kind of workload it takes for a MBA to throttle.

It‚Äôs an underwhelming CPU and GPU combo for a ‚Äúpro‚Äù level laptop. Granted all MacBook pros have been this way. But I really got my hopes up that this would be the difference. 2Tflops is pretty embarrassing.

For example, take Geekbench 5 (or go read anandtech's article on the A14), which is among the best synthetic benchmark out there, arguably the best. The A14 on an iPhone 12 scores around 1500 in single-core and around 4000 on multi-core, that's with a TDP of 5 watts (for the entire SOC, not just the CPU).  The 4800U has a single-core score of around 1030 and a multi-core score of 5840 with a TDP of 15 watts (just for the CPU).  The reality is Apple is way, way ahead in CPU performance. And it's not that surprising, Apple can invest way more than Intel and AMD can, and Apple is also leveraging investments they made for a much more bigger market. Qualcomm will (likely already has, they are just stuck with Windows, that makes the software transition hard) overtake Intel and AMD. At the pace AMD is improving (which is mind-blowing), and assuming they can sustain it (a big if), AMD could catch-up with Apple and Qualcomm in the future (and will likely continue to leave Intel behind unless Intel pulls an incredible stunt).",1,1605050827.0

In fact, I'm fairly certain I mentioned power scaling being used on the BIG cores specifically .  > It‚Äôs also perfectly reasonable for an M1 in a MBA to set  to cap at a certain max clock and the MBP M1 to have a higher max. Yes the product names are the same but that has no impact on their flexibility to differentiate and use either binning or simply using power management configurations to set performance levels.  Sure, there is nothing stopping them from doing that other than not wanting a lawsuit or being accused of deceptive advertising. Imagine Intel called all their CPUs by the generational name only. So if you bought a computer with an ""Ice Lake chip"" you had no idea which one of Intel's processors you were going to get.   If I bought an ""Apple M1 chip with 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine"" MacBook Air instead of the ""Apple M1 chip with 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine"" MacBook Pro and I then I discovered that ""Apple M1 chip with 8-core CPU, 8-core GPU, and 16-core Neural Engine"" does not mean the same thing in both computers, I would be pissed. I would believe I was mislead into believing I purchased A when I was sold B.  On Apple's website, the SoCs are advertised as being the same. All the marketing language refers to the M1 **chip**, not chip**s** or M1 chip family. There is literally no differentiation between the the two in name; no mention of clock speeds, power targets, or boost caps; and no listed model numbers. Everything points to a single chip set with equal specifications other than the MacBook Air is offered with an M1 chip that has one GPU core disabled as well (which one should reasonable assume does not offer the same performance as the full SoC).  There are plenty of other reasons why someone would buy the MBP over the MBA such as battery life, active cooling, etc. Additionally, Apple doesn't need to increase or decrease performance on the MBP over the MBA via purposeful caps on the chipset at sale because the M1, like all processors and SoCs, is going to limit itself based on thermals. Apple doesn't need to change the chipset clocks or power because active vs passive cooling is going to increase the performance of the MBP over the MBA anyways. As an extreme hypothetical, let's assume that as some point, it is possible for the M1 MacBook Pro to thermal throttle. If that was the case and Apple also sold a MacBook Super Pro for an additional $1,000 with the exact same M1 SoC that was magically cooled by an endless supply of LN2, they wouldn't need to change anything either because the SoC would be able to have increased performance over the MacBook Pro simply because it would be impossible for the MacBook Super Pro to thermal throttle and thus would have increased performance over the MacBook Pro which can thermal throttle. If you have a currently have a MacBook Pro, you can crack that thing open, modify the cooler to use a water cooler (or hell, even use it inside of a commercial walk in freezer, and you would see increased performance over what you currently get without modifying power limits or overclocking the CPU.  Performance on mobile form factors are normally limited by thermals, not on what the processor itself is capable of doing if thermals are not an issue.",3,1605065384.0

2458,gbwhui8,t1_gbwhtqv,wikipedia_text_bot,"**[ARM architecture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ARM architecture)**  ARM (previously an acronym for Advanced RISC Machine and originally Acorn RISC Machine) is a family of reduced instruction set computing (RISC) architectures for computer processors, configured for various environments. Arm Holdings develops the architecture and licenses it to other companies, who design their own products that implement one of those architectures‚Äç‚Äî‚Äåincluding systems-on-chips (SoC) and systems-on-modules (SoM) that incorporate memory, interfaces, radios, etc. It also designs cores that implement this instruction set and licenses these designs to a number of companies that incorporate those core designs into their own products. Processors that have a RISC architecture typically require fewer transistors than those with a complex instruction set computing (CISC) architecture (such as the x86 processors found in most personal computers), which improves cost, power consumption, and heat dissipation.

2467,gbvy70o,t1_gbvv8s1,augustofretes,"> I high doubt it was talking about performance of CPU + GPU since if thats the case, ANY laptop with a dedicated GPU would ""outperform"" it in this case since the apple silicon GPU is rumored to perform between 1050ti and 1060.   The vast majority of laptops don't come with dedicated GPUs.   > Also, apple clearly nitpicked about the discrete GPU being the best, it's easy to assume that if their CPU and solely the CPU performance was the best, they would brag about that as well.  They can't say it's the fastest CPU without adding a bunch of caveats (e.g. TDP).  > But to say that the M1 is simply outperforming ryzen 4000's in CPU performance is kind of stretching it since there are no indication of that as if this were true, Apple would've mentioned it.  Apple didn't mention at all Intel or Ryzen, and they mostly compared the M1 against their own Intel Macs. We can trivially estimate the performance of the A14 with two extra cores (and 4 more GPU cores), which is for most intent and purposes what an M1 is, precisely because we know the single core performance and we also know how the architecture scales because we've seen it before (A12 to A12X/Z).  The M1 will likely perform a little bit better in single core performance than the A14 on an iPhone, because it's less thermally constrained, but I wouldn't expect a noteworthy difference. The rest comes from just having more cores, the A12Z is about 65% faster than the A12 in multi-core performance, so even a conservative estimate puts the M1 multi-core performance ahead of the 4800U and slightly higher than that of the 4800H (which has a 40 watts TDP!). Keep in mind the Air and the iPad Pro are 10 watts envelopes with no active cooling.  The A14 runs at 2.89 GHz on the iPhone 12, so there's theoretically plenty of headroom. On the Pro, they could try to run them at a higher clock speed, but I wouldn't expect more than a 15% improvement, the difference between the Air and Pro will probably be almost entirely about sustained workflows.",1,1605055366.0
