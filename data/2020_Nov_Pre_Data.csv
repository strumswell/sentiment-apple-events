4,gbtaxtw,t3_jrerd9,qpgq,"I remember the Intel transition so well. It was so hyped and hotly anticipated. Rightly so.   Looking back though, it feels like today has the potential to be a more significant event for the industry.   2005 was a consolidation. In 2004, Mac (and broadly by extension PowerPC) had less than 3% market share. They were joining the 95% of other computers on Intel.   Apple Silicon is a departure. The creation of what might be a mass-market, alternative architecture. Macs still haven‚Äôt cracked 10% market share. But if Apple can offer same performance, cheaper, with 150% battery life, for the first time since the emergence of the wintel monopoly, there is a small chance of real disruption.",31,1605001208.0

316,gbtx9yb,t1_gbtub5c,machineglow,"as much as we want to default to the price gouging history of apple, Apple does have an uphill battle.    a consumer right now would have to justify the following potential downfalls:  1) app compatibility 2) price 3) performance  We know app compatibility and performance is potentially tied together (x86 emulation may knock out any raw arm performance advantages).   Adding in price to the mix may be too much for a consumer to have to accept to justify a potentially higher priced apple silicon.    This is their first kick at the can and first impressions are *everything*.   If they don't knock it out of the park with a big splash, Apple silicon may be relegated to 2nd tier consideration for it's lifetime.    Think about it this way.  We all know AMD right now is absolutely killing it when it comes to ryzen 5000 vs. intel.  But there's still a HUGE communication and optics problem that prevents them from being the defacto CPU choice mainly because of their initial ryzen release and their perception that they're still single thread slower.   AMD's been selling ryzen for a few years now too and they still have to fight that initial first impression from general consumers which prevents making any huge gains.      Is apple willing to risk having apple silicon perceived as the ""more expensive AND more compatibility issues"" choice?    It's also similar to the iPadOS dilemma.  Everyone wrote off iPadOS as a desktop replacement because they slow played their iPadOS functional rollout even though it could very well work well for a lot of users these days.    My bet is that they need to make a huge first impression and adding higher price is only a short term gain and not a good long term strategy.",6,1605019517.0
