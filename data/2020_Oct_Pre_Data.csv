Between the unreliability of knockoff cables and the general negative image of a proprietary port, I imagine that Apple actually loses more money from the bad public image of the lightning port than they gain in revenue from the licensing.   The *only* factors keeping the lightning port on the phone at this point are probably ecosystem inertia and the *very* slight volume benefit of the lightning port.

I would strongly suggest a pre-order, that's the only real way to guarantee a phone for **you.** I work in a much much smaller store compared to urban areas (inventory reflects that) and generally we'd only have a few of a new device on launch, so maybe 1-3 per configuration. Generally speaking BBY won't carry the higher storage models in regular stock, same goes for most apple devices. Most of what you'll see in store will be close to base spec.",3,1602602675.0
