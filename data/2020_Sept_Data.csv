And the fitness app looked awesome. Different types of fitness classes for $10, working well with my Watch and Apple TV, instead of one service for yoga, one for fitness etc. That looked cool.  The Apple One subscription is tempting too. I'd want Fitness, so it would have to be premium for $30. And I don't know how good Apple Music is now  (I tried it on release and stuck with Spotify). But for 2GB iCloud, Fitness and Apple Music, it could be worth it. Then to get the other services included would be a bonus.
