I remember watching the keynote, sitting next to my bf, and telling him “nah. I’ll wait for the 12”. I can live without 120hz, but it sure would be nice!

345,g5d2upy,t1_g5cz2cc,lasdue,I think the main difference will be the screen. The Air 4 will probably have a more basic screen compared to the 120hz ProMotion on the Pro.,2,1600182841.0
346,g5d6gpn,t1_g5cz2cc,ChemicalDaniel,"iPad Air 4 -Similar Design to the iPad Pro (2018) -A14 Processor -Touch ID in the power button (may be a deal breaker for most that may find a 2018 Pro for a similar price) -10.8” Screen -NO Pro-Motion -Support for Apple Pencil 2nd Gen -Support for Magic Keyboard case -More colors -$599  Those are what the leaks say. I’m a bit skeptical about the Touch ID in the power button though. Touch ID made sense on the home button because 9 time out of 10 you were using it to wake your device. With an iPad Air and a massive screen, you’re most likely going to tap the screen to wake. Then you’d have to move your entire hand and put your finger on the power button. The TrueDepth camera system is probably much more expensive on the iPad, considering that it can unlock from any orientation, but i dont know if apple would make that sacrifice and go back to an “inferior” (their words not mine) technology.",1,1600184453.0

Not having an LTPO panel might have been why Apple decided to cut the feature last minute, they probably were using software to predict when the user wanted to use 120hz or 60hz, and it just didn’t work or hit battery life hard. The LTPO panel only *just* premiered on the Note 20 Ultra, and usually the notes get the best screens before the iPhones do. 100% Pro-Motion comes out next year, if they do come out with something this year it would probably just be a toggle in accessibility options to enable a high screen refresh rate.",6,1600177624.0

Nothing about Android makes me want to stay (besides USB C and even that isn't a big deal).  What makes me lean iPhone is easily the seamless integration with my MacBook and iPad. And features like iMessage, AirDrop (yes Android has this now but I can't ""Nearby Share"" my iPad/MBP), and iCloud syncing my Safari tabs, notes, etc.  I know Android can do seamless syncing too but it's so fragmented and takes some setting up (in my case I now use Google stuff).

I mean levels of smooth and stable like nothing I have ever seen before.   But you know what? The operating system is the same across ALL iPhones. With very little differing user experience.  So I handed back the pro and got myself the SE and I’m reasonably happy. Saved 500 euro in the process. Pictures aren’t as good but not a 500 euro difference either.   I’m sticking with IPhone because I like that everything is ready to go. No more setting up and tweaking for hours. Everything is already optimised out of the box (it just works .... cringe but true) and I have two young kids and I’ve realised how important video is to me now. And Apple imovies is fantastic for making my home movies on the go.   Hoping the 5.4 IPhone 12 is good because I value a good small phone and hate Touch ID,1,1600159364.0

This is the company that changed the world with a phone. There’s a reason AirPods are one of the best-selling products of all time lmao, they were fucking magic when they were introduced and for good reason. You still can’t find an equivalent today. Going from Windows to MacOS and Android to iOS is such a night and day different experience it’s not even funny.
