I'm in my early twenties but I've noticed recently that these days (past year/couple years) that there's been a growing trend of ""crippling acceptance"" over people's fears/difficulties. These quite common fears people have - public speaking, socialising etc - instead of being seen as a thing you can overcome with a little courage and effort, it's treated almost like an incurable disorder, that it's okay to have, to ignore that you have a problem and find ways to avoid ever facing it entirely. It's builds terrible character and you're going to face it eventually. Everyone is terrified of public speaking when they first do it, but we get better at it as times goes on. If it's part of your job like this lady's she's going to have to learn or find another avenue of work.  Speaking in front of a camera is a whole other skill entirely, and just as daunting/difficult to do well anyway.  I'm tired of a percentage of society growing softer, and acting like it's okay for everyone to huddle up in their safe spaces their entire lives and never confront anything that remotely intimidates them. That's not a way to live. If I never faced my fears I'd still be incredibly shy and antisocial living a miserable life, unable to work because I wouldn't be able to deal or talk to people.

It's actually a stinking great idea beyond being able to use something other than traditional laptops and workstations - I can build environment images that include everything anybody on my team might need to do their job, no more headache of reinstalling development tools after imaging a laptop, no being tied to your one system because that's where all your code and local development database live, you just login to Che from any browser and your project is right there ready to run and debug.
