0,e8qbzjw,t3_9sp2ka,harshlady,So who is the target market for a MacBook vs a new MacBook Air now? The MacBook seems less powerful (still 7th gen processors) but starts out more expensive (but I guess higher storage).   PS RIP Rose Gold MacBook. Nice to see the new gold on a bigger device though. ,117,1540914529.0

9,e8qcvll,t3_9sp2ka,chris888222,"General thoughts:  **MacBook Air**: LONG overdue. I'm REALLY bummed that this notebook does not feature the quad core i5-8250U though. Nice, but expected design. Kinda odd that Apple continues to sell the 13 inch Pro without Touch Bar and did not update the 12 inch MacBook (which I thought might be discontinued because of the iPad Pro). Also, Apple is STILL selling the super outdated Air, like seriously...  **MacBook Pro with Radeon Pro Vega**: let's see if this is another thermal controversy. I am happy with my 2018 MacBook Pro 13 inch which I bought during the education special.  **Mac mini**: also WAYYYY long overdue. Seems like RAM is user-upgradable, but storage is not. Price hike might be hard for some to swallow however, with a core i3 and 128GB storage that is certainly not enough.  **iPad Pro**: A lot of good stuff in the keynote. Face ID in any orientation is great. The move to USB-C is awesome. The screen looks killer. However, as I compared the specs and prices to my existing 10.5 inch model, things start to fall apart. The new Pro's Apple Pencil is extremely expensive, much more so than the 1st generation. The rear camera in the new Pro may support smart HDR, but for whatever reason lack OIS and is downgraded to a 5-element lens. The base model still starts at 64GB. Removal of the headphone jack may not be a big deal to me, but it can be to many other people. Luckily, Apple still sells the 10.5 model (at the same price as it launched, what??)  The new products are great, but the prices on these new models are borderline ridiculous. The new iPad Pro really surprised me with the camera ""downgrade"". Some products that need updates aren't covered. I'm half amazed, yet half disappointed. ",58,1540915235.0

Up until they announced the price, I was all looking into the MacBook Air. If it were at or under $999, then it would have been a steal. Yet, I‚Äôm not sure if it‚Äôs worthy getting the new Air if the introductory price is $1199. At that price, might as well get a MacBook Pro for the same price.

43,e8qfggf,t3_9sp2ka,InvaderDJ,"Good presentation.  Unfortunately everything is a little more than I'm willing to play.  Was entertaining the idea of getting the new Mac Mini to use as a Plex server and a way to get more familar with macOS, but $799 base with no way to expand the storage (although bravo to them for at least allowing user upgradeable RAM) and an i3 CPU is a little much.  I might still do it, but I'll have to think about it.  The iPad Pro looks cool but at that price (looks like a $200 increase for the 256GB compared to the last generation iPad Pro 256GB) is a non-starter.  I also don't like no headphone jack, but I expected that.  Glad to see the Macbook Air get some love, but no USB-A ports is disappointing (although again, shouldn't be surprising).  I'll be interested to see how people react to it though.  The Macbook Air is beloved, but I think the price, low wattage CPU and no USB-A ports may cause some issues.

Longer answer: I took the computer to the genius bar, they told me the motherboard was fried, $1000 or something to fix, oof. I decided to look around online and found the graphics recall. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs gotta be it!‚Äù, I thought. ‚ÄúThe way the screen sputtered and stuttered around before the computer went black for the last time‚Äù.   Took it back to the genius bar, again they said it was the mother board. I gave up. Looked online and found a man in Oregon who would replace the motherboard for $450, so off to him the computer went. Came back in about a month, plugged it in good as new. However I noticed now my computer only supports one external monitor.   Gave the man a call, and welp... He had discovered that the GRAPHICS card needed replacing not the motherboard! Damnit Apple!   Anyway he replaced the graphics card with the wrong one, had to ship it back, etc etc big pain. Honestly with what I know now I would have done the replacement myself.   If I were you I‚Äôd recommend going to the genius bar and tell them this experience and see if they‚Äôll try replacing the graphics card and see if that‚Äôll fix it. Don‚Äôt be upset if they won‚Äôt, because they *think* that if they replace the graphics card because the computer is not working they wouldn‚Äôt be able to verify it‚Äôs installed correctly.    Very frustrating situation. I can send you a link to the guy in Oregon I used. He‚Äôs alright. I do think he tried to scam me out of a graphics card hoping I wouldn‚Äôt notice.   My computer is a mid-2011 iMac 27‚Äù, by the way. And two questions for you: Has the computer had issues turning on in the past? That‚Äôs a symptom mine had.

The EU has been pressuring Apple and other companies to adopt a common charging standard for years, and have been favoring USB-C for the past ~5 years or so.   USB-C is the small, device-connecting side of the cable, not the USB1/2/3 port that you would plug into the brick or a computer.   Previously, Apple and quite a few other tech companies signed an agreement (which expired in 2012) that they would standardize around micro-usb, which Apple never fulfilled - switching instead from 30pin to lightning ports.  There is no *existing* regulation *requiring* Apple to standardize, but the EU has been pushing on them and recently stepped up this pressure by beginning the prep work for legislation and exploring other options such as fines since Apple failed to hold up their agreement.

I actually saw no symptoms at all...computer went to sleep when I left to go to GABF one day and got a call from my wife a few hours later that it wouldn't turn on. Figured one of my little kiddos could have turned off the surge protector and didn't think much of it. Once I got home and couldn't boot it I tried to do a SMC reset and played around with a bunch of other things I read online from people with a similar issue.    Furtherest I got was getting all the fans to turn on at all full power when holding the power button and plugging it in at the same time....but nothing from the screen and no boot chime. Weird thing was at the Genius Bar I couldn't re-create this with their power cord, but it worked with mine so the tech had me leave my cord with them. They 1st tried a new power supply and that didn't work, so they called me and asked if I'd be willing to pay $570 for a logic board if that fixed it....I wouldn't have to pay if that wasn't the issue, but I didn't want to put that amount of money into an older iMac. I brought up the recall, but it having expired they didn't seem to think it was the graphics card for some reason? I did have it powering an older Cinema Display the entire 7 years I've had it, so not sure if that could have led to a graphics card failure?    I'm thinking about calling the Apple tech support line and trying to get them to dig deeper on this with the recall issue...tech who called me saying it was the logic board said he thinks it failed because of ""nicotine damage"" and I don't even smoke nor does anyone in my house so I'm clueless as to how that would even be brought up and upset he provided such a bullsh$t explanation.

Im personally buying one for my mobile recording and live sound rig as its a lot easier and more continent to sit at front of house with a mac mini and small monitor with full keyboard etc, rather than carrying around either a mbp and dealing with the the fixed position of a keyboard or an imac and paying a lot more at 1500 just to get a fusion drive. Plus when recording 32 tracks at a time for sometimes 2-3 hours, platter hard drives create a lot of reliability problems.
