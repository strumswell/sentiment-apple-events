Edit: ECG or Electrocardiography. The feature is FDA approved and can also detect AFib.

43,e5uzawy,t3_9fain3,TheTrotters,A few years ago a base flagship phone (iPhone 6s or 7) cost somewhere around $600-700. Base MacBook Pro cost around $1100-1300. And that wasn't cheap by any means.

The iPhone Xs might just be the smallest update in the history of the iPhone. It has improved water resistance, some new camera features, and the usual spec bumps. That's it.  Usually S years provide a new input method, like 3D Touch / TouchID / Siri on the 6S/5S/4S. That way, Apple alternates between a design update and a UX update. But the Xs offers neither of those things. It's just a spec bump. Very underwhelming.  On the other hand, the Apple Watch Series 4 looks incredible. Everything about that - from performance to the screen to the functionality - received a massive improvement. And the inclusion of an ECG is impressive as hell. And they managed to do all of that while retaining band compatibility. The one drawback is the increased price, but that's understandable, given everything that was thrown in there.  **My Ratings for the event:**  * **Apple Watch:**  9 out of 10  *  **iPhone:** 4 out of 10  * **Other stuff (demos, environmental, HomePod etc...):**  5 out of 10  * **Presenters:** 5 out of 10 (no Craig, Jeff is meh, and that new marketing woman seemed very generic)  * **Videos:** 8/10 (intro was good, the Apple Watch videos were excellent, and the others were quite good, as well.

I guess Apple wants the Xr to be the ""standard"" model like the 8? Then why the ever loving fuck is it so expensive?  I guess their logic is that it'll make the Xs and max look cheaper by comparison, but all it does is make the whole lineup look ridiculously overpriced for what...

These new phones are beautiful and probably work wonderfully.  But they don’t do anything new relative to, say, the 2012 iPhone 5.  We knew a bezel-less design was the natural next-step after the 5 (and it took 5 years).  Are we really pleased with the slight increase in battery life, Animojis, face recognition, and not-all-that-useful wireless charging?  That’s natural progress.    Apple is coasting.  If I were Apple’s board, I’d be fairly disappointed in Tim Cook.  All that cash, all those resources, and all these committed consumers... and this is what you led the organization to come up with in a year?  I’m sure they’ll sell a ton, though.

It costs about the same (actually more in some cases) as other flagships and even Apple's own offerings  They made the notch bigger.... sigh, I'm not excited for Android's part of the market in 2019, this is a BAD sign  No new macs, macbooks, accessories, iPads, and no comment on that AirPower thing they teased last year  So basically in an hour and 45 minutes all they talked about was: Apple Watch 4, and 3 iPhones. Definitely could've cut down on the total runtime if they got rid of the studio CEO segments, that gimmicky AR game, and the ""save the Earth"" lady part  P.S. iPhone XS MAX is a terrible fucking name",39,1536778502.0

If you do the IUP, you pay 54 a month and get Applecare+ included.   Now, factor in a $300 trade in, which is what you can usually expect for a two year old device in good condition. That brings the total down to around $900. So that’s $37.5 per month over two years.   Assuming $100 trade in for a three year old device, you get 30.55 per month if you upgrade after 36 months.

I can appreciate the compromise of the [Xr](https://i.imgur.com/VogY020h.jpg), and in fact I'm impressed that the only real sacrifices are the camera module and screen. It was rumoured to use the A11 chip, and to be honest for its price point I would've been really disappointed if that had ended up being the case.  I found myself more impressed by the Apple Watch Series 4 than the phone, with a few exceptions.  Chiefly the camera is headed in a great direction, and the depth changing ability is pretty nifty. Ultimately I'd like to wait and see how third party camera apps use this new functionality, but what they showed me came near to knocking my socks off.  What did knock my socks off is the new HDR, and how the dynamic range is shaping up for videos. Again, third party apps are going to make these improvements even better. I'm sure Filmic Pro was taking some notes.  The AR demonstration was really cool, even though the Galaga AR didn't really resemble Galaga once the little arcade cabinet exploded... It still looked fun. I've been looking forward to the potential of AR gaming since I first played with those AR cards that came with my 3DS.

I'm tempted by it, but the Apple Watch is the one part of the iOS ecosystem (besides the phone obviously) that I can't take with me if I go back to Android so I'm resisting the urge to upgrade my Series 2.  But I'm hella tempted.  The XS and XR are solid as well.  The names are dumb as hell (XS Max and XR anyway), but that's minor.  The XR was cheaper than I thought it would be and the iPhone 7 being close to $500 is a pretty good option if you don't care about the older design and want to get into iOS.  I wouldn't call them budget options, but the XR and older gen phones are close to that.  The XS Max is definitely going to be my choice this year.  I would have liked to know how they improved Face ID besides making it faster though.  I held off last year because of fears of how it would work with a lazy eye and I didn't see any mention of specific improvements in that case.  But other than that, I'm all aboard.  Unlike last year though, I'm going to put serious thought into the 64GB model.  I sprung for 256GB and even with me stressing the storage (shooting photos and video in max quality, not worrying about app sizes or downloads and downloading a crap ton of podcasts and audiobooks) I'm only at 88GB.  And that's after getting my phone replaced and keeping on apps I don't use like Garageband.  ~~I'm a little curious if the iPhone Upgrade Program is still a thing now and if Apple will let people who are on it pre-apply and basically lock in their reservation like they did last year.  They didn't mention that at all, but I'm hoping that was just in the interest of time.~~  I'm a little shocked that there was no mention of AirPods or AirPower, but I'm thinking Apple will put those into whatever iPad/Mac event they do later this year.  That was a good keynote overall though.  Just about everything was leaked of course, but them having greatly improved products made that not a factor for me.  EDIT: Just checked the Apple Store app on the iPhone and it looks like you can pre-apply and get everything set up so on Friday all you have to do is check out.  But damn, $60.33/month for 256GB and $68.66/month for 512GB.  Again, Apple knows what they're doing.  A 128GB model that was like $57-$58/month would be a no-brainer for me.  But making the jump all the way from 64GB to 256GB gives that anxiety on whether or not I need more than 64GB of storage.",0,1536780245.0

If the watch encourages people to get healthy that's great, but the ECG/Afib detection is really a gimmick at best. It can't be a full ECG since you need multiple leads for it to physically function properly as they read off each other (single leads are only used in very specific scenarios). Even if it could magically give a full 12 lead ECG, the screening potential for ECGs are just woeful. In fact you don't really ever screen asymptomatic people with ECG unless they already have CV problems or risk factors. If they're really having symptoms they're going to a doctor anyway to get a proper ECG.  A fib detection may actually be a little useful, but once again there's a reason why no country in the world screens random people for A fib even though it's extremely easy, convenient, and cheap to screen to do it now. Hell most decent doctors can probably quite easily pick up an irregular rhythm just by feeling your pulse for a few seconds.  However, A fib is not cancer-- early detection really is not the key. The problem is there's no good management plan available for silent/paroxysmal AF in an otherwise healthy person, so in most cases, all you're doing is telling people they have a serious heart problem which massively increases your risk for stroke but the best thing is to do nothing-- you're just adding a lot of stress and worry to people for no reason for something you can't really do much about.  It's better to let the person present in the regular way or only screen people who have verified risk factors.  In short, it's going to be about as useful as the HR or saO2 monitor are which are available on phones now.

Once upon a time, I was able to afford the entry level MacBook Pro and flagship iPhone, but there is no way I can comfortably afford new Apple products now. My Macbook Pro (Mid 2012) which is well over due for retirement was NZ$1,899 (US$1,245) at launch. Now the entry level Macbook Pro is NZD$2,199 (US$1,440) and if I want to match the 500GB storage I have on my 2012 MacBook Pro, I have to pay a whopping NZ$2,899 (US$1,900). Granted, its now an SSD and has much better hardware vs the 2012 MacBook Pro but when you look at the competition, you can't really say you're getting bang for your buck. My 128GB iPhone 7 was NZ$1,399 (US$915) at launch, now the flagship model with 256GB storage (Mid option) is NZ$2,199 (US$1,440). Again, Apple would probably argue that the Xs is a new ""high-end"" category and the entry level Xr is comparable to the 7 but even the 128GB Xr is NZ$1,499 (US$985).

It's no huge jump from owning an 8+ or an X in terms of features, but that extra screen real-estate will be nice.  One of my only complaints about the X I bought is screen size. Technically it's ""bigger"" than the old 6+ I had, but it doesn't feel it thanks to the aspect ratio and the notch. Every time I pick up my old 6+, I almost want to switch back because I like that form factor better.  The note 9 and the XS clearly has a massive screen, so comparatively speaking the note 9/XS are both great choices on that end. The only problem is, I can't switch to a note 9. I'm so deeply ingrained in the apple ecosystem that I have no choice but continue. I can't walk away from iCloud, iMessage integration, FaceTime, all my devices working together to give me a seamless experience from desk to car to TV etc...   So... yeah. I'd agree that the note 9 is a better phone at this price point in terms of what it can do, but I'd lose a lot of functionality if I switched to the note 9 at this point, which means it's a non-starter. If I want that bigger screen, and I do, I'm stuck with the XS as the only option.  I do wish it was a bit less expensive though - or that they went through with adding a few more of the note 9 features on this thing. They can talk ""neural chips"" all they want, but the reality is this phone is going to feel functionally identical to any phone made in the last 3-4 years in 99% of the tasks I'm going to ask of it.

Traditionally (I'm working off anecdotal experience here), if you purchase the phone in full from Apple you will receive an unlocked phone with a carrier SIM installed. Some years there have been minor differences in the actual hardware (supported LTE bands or w/e), and other years have had phones that basically supported all bands and the only difference was the SIM card.  &#x200B;  The 5S, SE, and 6S were all ""T-Mobile"" iPhones that I purchased on or near release, and they are all unlocked and usable on other carriers. The 5S was on StraightTalk and then T-Mobile.  &#x200B;  I think that the only time the phone is ""locked"" to a carrier anymore is if you purchase the phone with a payment plan. That being said, I've read of folks buying from a carrier store, paying full price, and then finding out later that the phone was ""locked"". At least in the US, if you have fully paid off your phone, the carrier who currently has a lock on the phone can unlock it but you need a service plan for them to even talk to you about it in most instances.  &#x200B;  Tl;Dr - In my experience, full priced ""T-Mobile"" iPhones that I've purchased directly from Apple have all been unlocked.

1798,e5vez7j,t1_e5ve40r,heyyoudvd,"Absolutely. The larger display with the new [watch face](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/images/product/watch/standard/apple-watch-series4_watch-front-training_09122018_big.jpg.large.jpg) that it supports is going to make a huge difference for usability.  That might be the feature that has me most excited. One of the drawbacks with the current Apple Watch is that because the screen on a device like that is naturally so small, you can't see a whole lot of information at once, and that means you have to jump around the interface to do different things. And let me tell you, jumping around the interface is my least favourite part about the watch. There's nothing wrong with the interface, rather, it's the inherent nature of the form factor. When you have a tiny screen strapped to your wrist, you just want to look at it for a few seconds at a time. You don't want to have to fiddle with things. That's what your iPhone is for. The watch should be simple and glanceable.  Anyways, the new watch face supports so much more information (see the screen shot), that it makes things much more visible and easy to access. The screen is more than 30% bigger in a device that's about the same size (and actually thinner) with more info readily available. That will change the whole experience, much like how increasing the size of the iPhone screen from 3.5"" to 4"" to 4.7"" to 5.8"" allowed people to use it in much more powerful ways and do a lot more with it. I suspect I'll get the same feeling from the new watch. And that has me excited.",4,1536791859.0

In fact we hand out warfarin like candy to people with AF because it's probably one of the most significant medical interventions and is probably thousands of people a day from stroke. The problem is that in a young otherwise healthy person (which the overwhelming majority of people who this watch will diagnose-- as most elderly with AF have usually been picked up during a checkup) presenting with paroxysmal AF (i.e. just appears randomly for a little while) it's really thoroughly debatable whether you should do anything about it.  The risk of an actual stroke in such a patient is likely to be very very low, or at least close to on par with the chance of having an adverse effect from treating or managing the AF. So in this case what do you do? Do you put the patient on medications for their entire life which have like 1% chance of causing serious complications, or do you just let the person have AF without treatment which may have like a 1% chance of causing a stroke. You can never know. Remember the principle ""Do no harm"". By diagnosing the AF you haven't really made this patient's situation any better or worse, simply added stress and anxiety. It probably would have been better had the diagnosis not been made.",1,1536866893.0

Maybe next year, if 2nd generation Face ID hardware is a significant improvement, I'll finally upgrade. It's not about cost - I could buy several dozen top of the line iPhones without any debt. It's about value: at the end of the day, no newer phone really enables me to do anything that I'm not doing now.  When I got the 6, it was because it offered 2 new capabilities that would fundamentally change how I used the phone and what I could do with it: Touch ID and Apple Pay. I look at every iPhone since, and don't see anything as compelling as those.  * Face ID: biggest change, but it's a mixed bag. Much nicer than Touch ID in some situations to be sure, but fails in some situations where I use Touch ID a lot.  * AR: great for fun demos, little real-world applicability.  * OLED: nice, slight improvement, but my screen is just fine.  * Headphone jack: regression. I'll be thinking about this as I watch movies with headphones while charging on my trans-Pacific flight later this month.  * Status bar: regression, with less room for useful info.  * 3D Touch: while I'd probably use it, nobody I know does. Therefore developers don't put much effort into it.  * Haptic feedback: doesn't change usability or let me do anything new.  * Better camera: nice, but I'll still carry a real camera when I want better image quality. Doubt very much that I'll leave the good camera at home any more often; I'll just get slightly better quality when the phone is my only camera.  * Faster/more memory/etc: definitely nice, especially since iOS 11 runs like dogshit on my 6. But it sounds like iOS 12 will help a lot. And even this won't fundamentally change how I use the phone, or enable new capabilities. It'll just be a little easier/better.  Ultimately, I think about what usage will be like after upgrading. And after the initial excitement of ""new"", it'll be the same old stuff. Checking email. Text messaging. Browsing the web. Looking up things on Yelp. Reminders. Checking my bank accounts. Maps & directions. Controlling smarthome devices. All of the stuff that makes a smartphone so useful is all doable on my 6.

The latest IOS runs fantastic (smooth and fast) on the device, and it's still a perfectly functional iPhone.  For awhile there (in the run-up to the iPhone X and battery-gate) the phone was slowing down and running like crap, but a new battery and the new IOS brought the phone back to life. Hell, if it was running this well when the X came out, I probably would have skipped the X entirely. The 6+ is still perfectly usable today and it still looks fantastic.  I see no reason why the 6+ couldn't still be used a year from now, so a five year period isn't unreasonable for a flagship these days.  Maybe the XS/XSMAX will have the same kind of lifespan. Certainly it seems they could be 5-year-phones from a computing hardware standpoint. My experience with OLED screens on smartphones dates back to the galaxy nexus days, but I remember that screen looked like absolute garbage after a couple years - so I guess the jury is still out on whether the X's OLED screen will avoid burn in issues, but as long as the display holds up I'm dead certain the phone itself will still be plenty powerful to be using it four or five years from now.

The diamond shapes were chosen to maximize the sub-pixel packing and achieve the highest possible PPI. The greens are oval because they are squeezed between the larger red and blue ones.  Traditional LCDs use a RGB pixel layout.   The effective resolution is like 30%~ lower on OLED (depending on the subpixel matrix) than LCD. That's why in like 2012 the Galaxy S3 had a 720p OLED display, but it looked SIGNIFICANTLY less sharp than a similar resolution LCD display. It had less subpixels so it's effective resolution was around 540p.   In modern day, this doesn't matter as much. 1440p OLED is plenty sharp enough.

2749,e5vdg59,t1_e5v7a41,mochacola,"My point was, how Apple did things, isn’t how most lineup work. For example, BMW will update every model in its entire line every year. Same as Huawei, Samsung, Xiaomi coming in with full range of price offering top to bottom and updating every model in their entire line every year. This is what Apple shareholders had been asking from Apple since iPhone 4. Which Jobs rejected.  This is also why people have the wrong impression that Apple phones just keep getting more and more expensive. Think of it as Mercedes starting only with C class, and then, started developing E class, and finally making S class, for a full line up. As opposed to making one class more and more expensive while keeping older models cheap.   Apple took their sweet time to create the full line we have today. That had been their plan more than a decade ago, if you had listened to debates between Apple management and shareholders who demanded full line. Obviously, Apple management was right and shareholders were wrong.  Notice last year’s X was discontinued like how “normal lineup” works?  SE was their entry level market model just like C was meant for. Xr will appeal to most, at least in expectation. SE replaced C’s spot, which is now replaced by 7 in their line.  Which is why whenever people say they want SE2, I’d tell them iPhone 6 is SE2, there won’t be SE2. Even if there’s a X in SE form factor, it would be X mini, or whatever, which won’t be priced anywhere near SE, or a replacement for SE but a variant of X-class.   ",0,1536790439.0

With almost all OLEDs, Apple’s included, each ‘pixel’ consists of 2 subpixels — every pixel has green, but the other one is either red and blue, in an alternating pattern.  These numbers aren't directly comparable, because the 'pixels' are nowhere near the same thing.  For instance, the Xs has 229 red subpixels per inch, while the iPhone 6 has 329. If you have pure red text on a black background, the OLED has substantially less detail.  And... this starts to get a bit weird, because if we're just optimising for ordinary use cases, the iPhone XR's 326ppi LCD is enough that people couldn't 'extra', at 'normal' viewing distances [28cm, according to Apple].  So, at 458 ppi, OLED is better if you're holding it unusually close, and it's worse if you're looking at just blue/purple/red... but mostly it just doesn't matter, because you can't see the difference anyway.  See also -- the Galaxy S9+ has a 1440x2960, 529ppi OLED. By default, it runs at 1080x2200/396ppi.

Remember when cell phones first came out? People paid huge premiums to get the smaller ones. The Motorola Razr cost a fortune when it was released, as did the Startac before it.

We're getting into a lot of semantics right now, and as you say we don't have a the data needed to argue some of the points.  However, in general you are right, if you compare what the Xr can do for $750 to other phones on the market right now, the price point does not add up, but you can argue that for just about every Apple device under the sun, especially their computer line. Apple tech is overpriced, but at the same time there is more to a device purchase than just specs, there is buying into the OS and ecosystem, the app community, etc. Apple and Android devices can not be compared side-to-side IMO, as their value is going to be radically different for consumers based on what ecosystem they've bought into and what features/style they value in an OS.  My argument is that the Xr has a purpose in the line-up Apple just announced: the 8 is now two generations old, and if you have an old device and have been waiting to buy into the next gen to get the better speeds (and longer support life associated with next-gen chips), new camera features, AR/Face ID, etc. but don't really care about getting the absolute best display quality (because let's be honest, most people cannot tell the difference between OLED vs. LCD and PPI in day-to-day use), the Xr gives you an opportunity to get into the latest generation of devices without having to pay a significant price for a display that doesn't necessarily interest you.  If you look at the device from that perspective the PPI is perfectly adequate and the Xr is an impressive piece of hardware, and while it may be more expensive that it needs to be, someone shouldn't really be buying Apple products to begin with if they want to pay what things are actually worth.",1,1536790788.0

There are a few very high-end cinema cameras used today that only shoot 1080P, because there's a lot more to getting a good picture than the resolution.  You're simplifying the PPI of a display to it's quality, and then broadening out the argument to how overpriced the Xr is.  The Xr is overpriced, you're absolutely right. So are all Apple products. But the display on 8, and thus the display on the Xr, is certainly far from shit, and saying that they are shit because they're PPI has not changed is completely ignoring all the other factors that go into making a good display.",1,1536812236.0

The ones who said push this swift stuff before it was ready (i hope its ready now in 12 - it does look fun).

The list really does go on and only in the last 3-4 years or so.   I freakin love(d) apple.

3147,e5vv1ny,t1_e5vkl0x,NotRoryWilliams,"Assessing whether insurance is a good value really depends on your prediction of whether you will use it. Insurance usually works out to be a good deal if you use it even once in the course of the policy. There are now two versions of Applecare+, one that only covers damage ($199) and one that also covers loss or theft ($299). The cost of an incident without the insurance is generally more than the total cost including the insurance. Supposing you get the higher policy, if you drop the phone and crack the back glass, the total cost ends up being $398: $299 premium plus $99 copay. Without insurance, the same incident is $550 at the out-of-warranty flat rate. Even worse for loss or theft - there’s no discount for a replacement without insurance, so a replacement top-model phone is $1449 plus tax, vs $568: $299 premium plus $269 copay. Still fairly expensive as insurance goes, but better than half price, closer to a third.   Now, again admittedly, that’s actually a fairly shit value ratio for an insurance policy... basically only pays off if it’s used 1/3 of the time. But since the potential opportunity cost of not having it is anywhere from $200 to $1000, it’s worth it to the clumsy at least. Me... I’ve out-of-warranty damaged three out of maybe a dozen iPhones I’ve had, so maybe you’re right, my historical odds are just below the threshold for this policy quite being a sure bet. And I’m probably harder on phones than most. All the same, I’m a very conservative risk-assesser (an odd statement for a whitewater kayaker who drops waterfalls and a skier who goes fast and takes jumps). I just feel safer taking the insurance, and I’m probably going to spring the extra $100 for the theft protection. ",1,1536807986.0

3149,e5vz8dx,t1_e5vyrlq,deleted,"> Dude, pixel density doesn't fucking matter past a certain point.  Lmao that's not what Apple has been saying all along. They've been marketing their Retina iPhone displays for ages.   And that's just Apple's marketting which you're directly contradicting. The reality is that it does matter.   >Pixel density doesn't need to go up every year,  It'd be nice if it went up at least once in 5 years and for 5 times higher the price. You'd expect that from one of the richest companies in the world selling only high-end phones. To make literally some change in 5 years. And for 5 times more what you're spending. Again, they've used high resolution displays as one of their key marketing points for years.   > 326 PPI looks great on devices of that size, I'm a total quality snob and I used a 7 Plus for years without a single complaint.

3156,e5w0kou,t1_e5vz8dx,Bobking11,"Touché on the 7 Plus PPI, I'm actually surprised that's different, since the PPI was the same on the two iPad Pro models I was looking at earlier. Weird.  Regarding your points above, the display has changed in 5 years. True Tone, brightness, the contrast ratio, the display is evolved from where it was in the past, along with certainly a ton of other factors we agreed we don't know enough about to explore. Maybe the PPI didn't go up, but for Apple OLED is the future and I don't see them putting more R&D into improving a soon-to-be-obsolete (for Apple) technology when the current PPI is perfectly serviceable. Moreover, the Xr is not targeted at display snobs, and the customer who cares about getting every pixel of resolution out of a display possible would already be buying the Xs.  Overall, is the Xr overpriced and underperforming against Android competitors in the specs department? Absolutely.  Does it have a place in the current iPhone lineup? In my opinion, yes, but that's debatable.  Is the display shit because an old Android phone had the same PPI in 2013? Absolutely not, it's a kick-ass display that's come a long way from that old device.  You're trying to argue the third question to convince me of the first, and that's what led to this huge debate even though we seem to agree on the overall.",1,1536814687.0
