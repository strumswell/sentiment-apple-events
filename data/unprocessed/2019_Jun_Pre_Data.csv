I remember reading rumors prior to WWDC 2018 that suggested Apple had changed their release schedule to allow engineers to work on features until they felt they were ready for the prime time.  This in turn gave us iOS 12, which was an incredible release in terms of stability. A welcome change after a rather buggy experience with iOS 11.  Ever since then reading those rumors early last year I have been wondering just what iOS 13 will be. It was strange as leading into WWDC 2018 I wasn't expecting much of anything, knowing that any exciting features will be pushed back to WWDC2019.

Especially when you use Family Sharing, and the apps are spread out over multiple accounts.

Thats okay, not every feature has to be for every user. I don‚Äôt use MacOS Finder color tags, but their existence doesn‚Äôt bother me.

Does Instacart go with food or retail? I have a bunch of apps for wine reviews and beer reviews... do I cluster them together or include them with food? Some of them also let me order stuff, so they could go in retail. Some of them (like Untappd) have a social network component. Etc etc.  This all makes choosing locations for apps arbitrary guesswork. This is a solved problem on MacOS. I‚Äôd make an alias and put a reference to each app in every folder where it makes sense.

They seem to arbitrarily negotiate who will be the ""connected"" Home Hub, and it usually rotates whenever I reboot an AP or switch. Sometimes the HomePod becomes the Home Hub and I just deal with it. It's just frustrating that Apple recognized the need to disable the Home Hub function on Apple TV devices, but you can't do the exact same thing on the HomePod.  For me, the main problem is that the HomePods aren't ideal Home Hubs. They only support Wi-Fi and they are in areas of the house where they likely don't have good connectivity to some of the Bluetooth HomeKit devices. The ATVs are positioned in great locations to be the Home Hub and they're connected by wired Ethernet. I just want to prevent the HomePod from taking precedence in those Home Hub elections.  Or if Apple really wanted to grant my wish, they would let me set the order of priority for Home Hubs, so that I can put the ATVs on top. Then if both ATVs go offline for some reason, the HomePod is next in line as a backup. And when the ATVs come back online, they'd still be higher on the priority list so they would take over again.
