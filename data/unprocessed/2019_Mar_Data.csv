""sneak peak"", 100 games but no real info.

They’re not even consistent, with most things following a naming convention, and then other just not. I’m looking at you air power.

I work for a competing digital magazine product that I won't name here as I don't want my account to be known as a shill - but I can speak on why people would pay for this service.  Apple have seen the opportunity in magazine content. It isn't all about the breaking news alert that once consumed is done forever. It's about lifestyle choices and changes. It's about researching cool places to go on holiday. It's about looking up the latest design and fashion trends. It's about new workout routines. New food choices and diets. All in a clean, easy going, relaxing medium.   So the simple answer to your question is that you're not really paying for the news service at all - in fact, breaking news is still available for free in the existing News app. You're paying for curated content that has been put together not just by Apple's editors, but magazine editors who are experts in their respective fields.

The extent of my gaming currently consisting of not much much more than Words with Friends and trying to make my way through The Last of Us in half hour increments every now and again when I get time, I couldn’t say that I’m a gamer. Another issue is the gaming landscape has changed so much since then that I’m not sure what kind of game I like nowadays, and haven’t really decked too much into it because I don’t want to drop cash on games that I might not like.  I feel like a paid subscription service could help with these things as there’s no financial penalty / risk related to trying a whole bunch of games.
