Making their own TV shows and movies is a risky move. It has literally cost the company **BILLIONS** of dollars.  And they‚Äôre playable on any ol‚Äô smart tv.  That‚Äôs a big shift coming from the company that cares so much about the user experience it makes its own hardware and software. Now you can just get their stuff anywhere, huh?

Suddenly, Apple have studios, creative control, technology and the user base to roll out AT SCALE AR movies and experiences.

However the movie industry was terrified by this, and prevents Netflix from getting all the new releases and if they get a new release they typically have to ""trade"" other movies for them.   These new movies also come after the movie is available for sale.   This sadly made it so Netflix is not the best source for movies, iTunes is.  Paying ala-carte on iTunes for rentals is actually the way to go if you want new movies streaming.  Netflix had to change their model and start producing good quality TV series so they could build their service up (so subscribers would not have a reason to leave).

Apple charges a premium because the products are perceived to be better quality, as well as for the branding. This means that the pricing cannot allow ubiquitous ownership. If everyone out there had AirPods, that image is gone. By moving into services, the goal will be to get Apple devices into as many hands as possible. This means lowering the price. One of Apple's core strengths is their absurd profit margin, and that goes out the window.  As I see it, they can't have both, and they haven't decided which way they'll go. I think, at best, we'll see companion services like Apple Music sprout up. They don't add anything to the mix, but they capitalise on the ecosystem and slowly bleed customers from other services.

565,ejc6wka,t1_ejc5kx2,russticate,"That's a fair comment to make. I didn't use iTunes match before I signed up for Apple Music because I've got a pretty extensive library and was happy with what I had. Being able to augment that library with anything else I want is a killer feature for me. I'll take it over any music discovery feature, I've discovered music by myself for years without any issue. Apple Music has it's problems for sure, but I feel like they're they only company that gets that there are old fashioned people like me to like to curate instead of just listening to playlists.
