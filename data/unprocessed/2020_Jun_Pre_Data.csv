Once you tap it, it will open [this menu](https://i.imgur.com/qZHb0Hk.jpg) and you click the circle circled in yellow and it will switch over [like this](https://i.imgur.com/A0gCaHh.jpg).  I *just* traded in my MacBook Saturday and the new one should arrive Friday or I would give you an exact example.
