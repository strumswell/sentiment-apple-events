16,g8prh7r,t3_jaiwph,MightBeJerryWest,"Other notes:  * Apple stock prices usually drop on keynote/presentation days anyway.  * Lack of a USB-C block is going to be annoying. I don't think they've included a USB-C as a part of any mainstream product, **exception being MacBooks and the iPhone 11 Pro** (iPad Pro is not quite mainstream). The Apple Watch S6 doesn't include a USB-C block, neither does the iPhone 12. The fact that it hasn't been included before is what makes this annoying. Had they kept the USB-A cable, then okay fine, we have millions of those blocks. But that's not the case for USB-C.  * MagSafe on the iPhone looks cool (bring it back for MacBook Pros you cowards).

When he opened his arms, I felt like he hugged me. * As usual, mockups don't do it justice. I was super skeptical about the flat sides before, but now I am onboard. * The Apple Anechoic chamber looks like it would be a very relaxing place to just chill out in. * A14: Apple takes a victory lap again, again, again, again * League of Legends: Apples exec team plays League confirmed. Imagine losing to Eddy Cue on his iPhone in the Apple Boardroom, sad. * MagSafe: Gonna have to feel that magnetic strength in person before I trust it to hold my credit cards on the phone by magnet power. * Removing EarPods and Power adapters: As someone with a box of unused EarPods and power bricks that I will never use, I am okay with this. Still think they should make it opt out so you can ask for one if you don't have it.  &#x200B;  iPhone 12 Mini  * Kaiann Drance is my new favorite Exec.

I already have a Qi charger, and almost all of the multi-port chargers I have from Anker have a USB-C port on them. I have plenty of USB -> Lightning cables around from previous devices. There IS a Lightning port on the new iPhone.  Hopefully people on the iPhone Upgrade Program aren't waiting long to get devices.

189,g8pxmg1,t3_jaiwph,WillTheGreat,"I think the biggest takeaway for me is the usual Apple focuses on this event.  Didn't talk about battery life. Didn't talk about security.  I mean for years there were the centerpieces of their presentation. To me they know they fucked up getting rid of TouchID and not bringing it back, didn't bother talking about FaceID and or any improvements, or address facial obstruction and the changes they could've brought to FaceID. Then not mentioning battery, seems like 5G is going to be a massive drain like early gen LTE phones (HTC Thunderbolt for example). Usually Apple prides itself in battery life and they make a huge deal about it in the presentation, but they didn't really mention it once. I doubt it'll be awful like first gen LTE phone bad, but I definitely expect it to be bad compared t past generation iPhones.   The biggest win is probably Apple targeting price after years of inflating prices on flagships, this one is definitely good for competition and consumers. The whole reason flagships started to push into the low Thousand mark was really because of Apple and their introduction of the iPhone 10, where it became acceptable for a $1000 phone. The fact that their top of the line is $1099 while others are pushing $1300 is pretty refreshing. Especially when you consider the quality of material and finishes Apple uses even at the $700 price point for the standard 12.   Honestly though, it was a pretty disappointing reveal, because they didn't address any real issues with the recent line up of iPhones. Should've just admitted they were wrong and brought back TouchID. Yeah, eventually things will go back to normal, but it hasn't, and vaccine or not, we don't have a real time line. Mask are still highly recommended for the foreseeable future, the fact that Apple didn't even touch on security is super disappointing.",4,1602615816.0

I was hoping they come out with metallic glass which would be an interesting concept and would look pretty cool... I know they have been working on that over at Apple for a while. In case you don‚Äôt know, glass simply refers to a non crystalline( amorphous) material. Metallic glass is not transparent, rather has the unique property of being unable to be plasticly deformed aka it doesn‚Äôt dent but reflects energy off the material upon impact and look shiny like a metal. That being said, it is like a ceramic with respect to brittleness but it isn‚Äôt as brittle... you could drop your phone and it mostly would not shatter but bounce off the ground back up to close to the same height from where it dropped under ideal conditions. There are interesting videos online of metallic glass.

I'd bet that the vast majority of people that bought the new one the year (or 3) before aren't getting this upset by the marginal upgrade.  Would people rather they release nothing for 2-5 years just to have a bigger difference between models?  Sure, more of a change would have been cool (especially since I'm hoping to switch back to an iPhone this iteration), but this overall design/feature-set has only been out for a few years and even the first iteration (iPhone X) is still a fairly capable device.  All that said, I am bummed by the removal of the charger with the change to USB-C for the charger-side (though I expected it). I have a few chargers around the house but wouldn't mind another one and I know most people (especially Apple mobile users) haven't switched yet.",2,1602615943.0

And as nice as it will be to have 5G capabilities (for those who live in a supported area), I guess it's good... but to be the main marketing feature when 5G isn't even particularly new in a lot of phones anymore seems weak.  I do like the removal of power adapters and earphones though, Apple are indeed correct to point out that there's already enough out there that there's no need to whinge when you don't get either in the box. Although I do think the slight camera bump (which we get every year anyway) and a 5G chip aren't really enough to be like 'and it's still the same price!' I would absolutely expect that anyway.

610,g8psefv,t3_jaiwph,InvaderDJ,"Hmm, very interesting keynote.  So the normal iPhone 12 and 12 mini are made much better with the higher resolution OLED screens.  I can't think of much reason to buy the Pros with that screen.  And I think Apple knows that, because unless I missed something they raised the price by $100 and didn't increase base storage.  Which would mean the iPhone 12 with 128GB of storage will probably be $850.  That's within spitting distance of the Pro at $999, which is annoying.  No high frame rate is also disappointing.  And while I didn't expect it, I'm upset they didn't bring back the fingerprint reader.  Only reason that I'll probably ""upgrade"" this year is so I can pass on my current iPhone 11 to my mom.  I'm trying to decide between the iPhone 12 and 12 Pro, with the screens on both being 6.1"" OLEDS now and the price difference being potentially only $150 (if you want more than 64GB storage) I don't know which way to go.  Also, did I miss it or did they not say anything about battery life?  They had the little bubble saying great battery life for all of them, but I didn't see the usual expected runtimes for phone calls, watching, video, etc.  With these things also being thinner yet again it makes me think battery life might be a regression from last year.  EDIT:  Checked the pricing on Apple's website.  You're paying $30 more if you don't go through a carrier (at&t and Verizon, T-Mobile and Sprint are the same as SIM free).  That means the 128GB model is $879 instead of $850.  It wasn't like that with the 11 was it?  I remember the storage upgrade being $50 whether you were buying through a carrier.  Of course the Pro doesn't have that little price bump, it's $999 across the board.  That is messed up, Apple is making it really hard to justify the 12.  You're within $120 dollars now if you want more than 64GB of storage.",1,1602613218.0

I liked that XR/11 and 11 pro max/XS max displayed exactly the same amount of information but in smaller size for XR/11, and I feel going for iPhone 12 is going to lose that, like less data displayed in width but more beautifully rendered.",1,1602625389.0

The blue on the standard 12 is beautiful, not a big fan of the pacific blue on the 12 pro.   Really don‚Äôt see the justification in getting the 12 pro over the 12. In that case, it makes me question whether I should downgrade from the 11 Pro Max to the standard iPhone line.

Like almost everyone knew every exact detail about the iPhone 12 before the event, and still *somehow* people were able to obtain photos of the iPhone 12 and HomePod mini iPhone XS style, and apparently the entire event got leaked on Twitter before it was over.  Hopefully they dont botch the ASi launch like this one. The WWDC 2020 conference was leagues ahead of this one.  EDIT: One thing i was pretty excited about was that they said they would ‚Äúbring MagSafe to the iPhones‚Äù, implying that maybe the new Macs would see the return of MagSafe.

Then they shoot themselves in the foot by including a USB-C to lightning cable which your existing power bricks aren't compatible with. If the 12 is the first iPhone you're buying and you only have an older PC/laptop with USB-A ports, you *have* to buy a USB-C power brick so that you can actually charge the device you just bought, or fuck around with a USB-A to USB-C adapter and get super slow charging.  Saying they're doing this ""for the environment"" while they're just looking to cut costs is such **blatant** marketing BS it's not even funny: if they had done away with the brick truly because of environmental concerns, then they would have included a compatible cable with the phone, so that you could keep using your old bricks with the new cables.

[From my comment in another thread:](https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/jahnx5/hi_speed_apple_event_event_megathread/g8pxppp/)  > The 12 Pro Max definitely has a better wide camera due to bigger pixels and a bigger sensor which will result in even better low-light photos. The sensor shift OIS on its wide camera will produce even steadier photos than before. >  > The telephoto on the 12 Pro has a f/2.0 aperture, whereas the 12 Pro Max has a f/2.2 aperture. In theory this means that the telephoto lens on the 12 Pro will perform better in low light situations than the telephoto on the 12 Pro Max. However, the 12 Pro Max telephoto camera offers a 2.5x optical zoom due to the greater focal length (the 12 Pro offers a 2x optical zoom). >  > The LiDAR Scanner on the 12 Pro and Pro Max enables night mode portraits. In addition, the Pro lineup offers some other things like Apple ProRAW, but that shouldn't matter too much if you really just want to take great photos quickly. >  > Other than that, the 12 and the 12 mini have the same cameras as the 12 Pro (without the telephoto and the LIDAR Scanner).

I'm concerned about the baseline inability to charge a new phone straight out of the box, exacerbated by the disconnect between connectivity technologies (USB C cable vs USB bricks).   I look at it this way: They are including a particular cable in the box, so I am excluding whether or not people already have x cable at home. They then present the argument that there are x power bricks in the world. But the vast majority of power bricks they state are out in the world, are not compatible with the cable they've included in the box. My argument is that there seems to be a very obvious disconnect here that a company the size of Apple could've easily afforded to avoid by providing compatible hardware over the next 2 new phone cycles since they are the ones now ushering in a new standard.   I included the MacBook/laptop bit because that is the next obvious source of power after the power brick. So doing very rough estimations of the % of iPhone users who have USB C MacBooks (power sources) right now, I‚Äôd wager it still doesn‚Äôt come close to the total user base.   So my overall point here, is that ""people already have cables/bricks at home"" seems to be doing a whole lot of heavy lifting for something that is not a totally testable/reliable statement, and seems to be an entirely unreliable solution to offer to customers who just purchased a hundreds-of-dollars new phone, in comparison to simply including a brick which would guarantee that they are totally able to charge their phone straight out of the box.",2,1602618785.0

I‚Äôve come to realize I spend 99.9% of my time in an app and muscle memory gets me to the icon anyway so I‚Äôm not missing much by not being able to create custom icons, widgets , gestures or themes.

No.   I still have my s9 and bust it out for this and that and I do miss some good lock functionality but again at this point navigating my phone is all muscle memory so I‚Äôm not too down about it. Battery life is stellar. Camera is nice. Screen I don‚Äôt notice the difference in my use cases. It is a bit heavier so extended use at night is always a gamble of if I‚Äôm going to drop it on my face or not.   I haven‚Äôt had to worry about multiple cables since the fast charge is nice and the battery actually lasts all day no matter what I throw at it unlike random google play services eating my battery it in an hour for some damn reason. So even that was at most a boogeyman situation for me. What will I do with having to have 2 cables!! GASP! I just keep my 1 lightning cable next to my bed. If I need to top up I let it sit for 15-20 minutes and go from 10% to 35-40% and I know that‚Äôll last me the rest of the day.

If the goal is to be carbon neutral by 2030 and help the environment, this may take the cake for the worst idea a company can have. Not only does it encourage customers to still get the accessories (Would you like to include a free charger for your new phone?) that they probably don't need, said accessory would come in a separate package exacerbating the issue.  &#x200B;  >2. Stop releasing a new phone every single year with negligible improvements in favor of releasing a new phone every 2-3 years with more significant improvements.  Progress is taken in steps. Say they figure out a way to eliminate an environmentally harmful material in their design. Say they make a process more efficient that can save millions of tons of carbon each year but you just dropped a new phone - sorry! Guess we'll implement that in three years.. Not only do you put off constantly improving tech year after you produce old less efficient tech for longer. Honestly, it's not even a defensible position to take.    &#x200B;  >3. Stop offering 7 different iPhones, in favor of only offering 1 *maybe* 2  This point is evidence OP shouldn't be taken seriously. Not only does it show a lack of understanding for how companies need to be competitive, or show the lack of understanding for the depth In needs for peoples smartphone use across the globe, it over-simplifies the idea that fewer options are better. In general this may be a decent rule of thumb. But we're talking about 7 phones released over 3 years that they sell today. Not 30 phones they've released since 2018. The issue with this is that it ignores the most important factor when judging the impact of each phone, and thats judging the impact of each phone instead of implying impact due to the new number of phones the company produced.  &#x200B;  >4. Make the iPhones properly serviceable rather than basically being disposable products.  They are making the phone more serviceable and have been increasingly over the years.   &#x200B;  >5. swap to usb-c so no one needs Apple specific cables in the first place.

These past couple weeks leakers confirmed that there would be no ProMotion since the 5G antenna depletes battery life enough that it wouldn't be good enough with both 5G and 120hz enabled. 5G is the more marketable feature, so they went with that.   touchID in the lock button would only make sense for enterprise/government phones that need an extra level of biometric security (requiring both would be cool), but otherwise faceID is what Apple's going with.

You assume everyone buying a phone has a compatible lighting-usba charger OR a usb c charging brick (let alone one that is capable of charging an iPhone). Have any statistics on that? Since you claim it‚Äôs a small minority of people, you must have some kind of data up your sleeve, right?  2.	For the sake of points 2 and 3, let‚Äôs assume that you‚Äôre correct about point one (kind of a stretch). There‚Äôs absolutely no indication that their usbc adapters have enough power to charge an iPhone (especially the pro models). For a company who frequently uses the tagline ‚Äúit just works,‚Äù it seems hilarious that they‚Äôd leave it up to consumers to figure out/buy something as important as a power source.  3.	In regards to slow charging: Yes, that is also an issue. Especially since Apple markets the phones as fast charging phones. It was an issue when they first shipped fast charging phones with 5w adapters and it‚Äôs become an issue again. The devices they sell now are more powerful. Someone‚Äôs 5w iPhone charger from their iPhone 6s box will be virtually useless unless the user sits by it for hours. That is a usability problem for a ***cellphone*** 4.	you can be wrong about two things at once. There can be a lot of incompatibility and usability issues at the same time!  5.	Since you care so much about waste, have you considered that almost every 5w adapter in the world uses usba and they will now be shipping hundreds of millions of usbc cables out which will be completely incompatible with the usbc bricks? What do you think is going to happen? Oh wait, people are going to buy usbc power bricks. All with separate packaging, paperwork, plastic (depending on the brand), shipping pollution, etc.   Edit: I like Apple. They‚Äôre my favorite of the big tech companies. I used to applaud every little thing they did. However, this decision hurts the consumer and maybe at best kind of sort of helps the environment a little bit. If they cared about the environment or humanity, there are much bigger things they could do that wouldn‚Äôt hurt the consumer (especially first time iPhone buyers).

I've had an android since the moto droid, and I was crazy into customizing my phones those days. Changing roms, changing roms with themes. back in those days changing roms actually increased performance on the phone + battery life. It was crazy. After the droid incredible, Phones were just good. No more need for bypassing the bootloader.  &#x200B;  Come around to today, and I don't really care much about my phone, it's just a phone. in the past couple of years I acquired an iPad, and replaced my windows laptop for a macbook. (Simply due to battery life, I still prefer windows)  &#x200B;  Using an iPad, made me more used to iOS, but there's still things in the ""ease of use"" that I far prefer over iOS  (For example, scrolling down from the top screen and holding the bluetooth enable in android takes you to the bluetooth settings, while on iOS you have to go to the actual settings, then bluetooth then change it. Making the process longer. Little things like that)  &#x200B;  So earlier this year, I was thinking it was time to truly give iPhone a chance due to the ecosystem. Then I noticed, I don't care about notes, I don't use iCloud(Google drive is where Im at), and i have imessage working on my note via  a mac mini server. Then there's little things about Android that I would be missing.  &#x200B;  Downloading files through the internet, using a file explorer app to go to it, and send it to my android TV via a fast created server(a quick fix to something I did for my tv a couple of days ago vs having to go into my computer). I would be losing some functionality through my phone that has been of random help throughout the years. (creating NFC tags was a big one a couple of years ago)  &#x200B;  Now i'm 50/50 if I'm jumping ship at all. I'm still kinda isolating due to covid, so I'm not out and about as much I used to be, I have no real need for a new phone if I spend over half my time at home. So I can still hang onto my note 8 till the iPhone 13. Then I'll compare the Note 2021, to the iphone 13 and Make my decision. Also, Apple not talking about battery life is a big worry for me, I care more about battery life nowadays than ""performance"".   &#x200B;  I'm petty enough that them not including a block charger ""because we're saving the environment and totally not to save a cool couple of millions"" made me not wanna buy the iphone 12. It's not about the cost to me, it's more about the principle. They could provide a charger for free if they truly were doing it for the environment via a voucher of some sort.",2,1602626605.0
