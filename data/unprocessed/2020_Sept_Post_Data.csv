12,g5dsvve,t3_ite7j6,hammerheadtiger,"It is unsurprising that the event would have WWDC levels of production value, but they really took it to the next level this time with the smoothed out transitions. The 'one continuous shot' aesthetic really rubs in just how much better Apple keynotes are to the competition. I like to try to spot where editors hide the transitions and I couldn't even tell for half of them. God tier keynote quality.  Impressions:  1. Apple Watch:    1. Product Red finally after all these years of rumors. Looks like I will be getting the new blue one though.    2. The Apple watch family deployment is genius for families with kids who don't want to give their small children a smartphone but need them to have the ability to call or text. And because its strapped on them, you don't have to worry (as much) about them losing it. I imagine the fewer entertainment/games distractions on the watch will be welcome as well.    3. I get the feeling that the Apple Watch SE is going to eventually come down in price and replace the Series 3. Kind of a Macbook Air/Macbook situation here where the replacement is too expensive to really replace the old one.    4. The Memoji Apple Watch face is the most narcissistic thing I have ever seen. Edit: I just had a friend tell me he is going to use it with his Shrek Memoji. It is the best watch face ever made.    5. Removing the power adapter: As someone who has a hundred adapters sitting in a box, I like the move, but I do wish that Apple Stores will give them for free to people who specifically ask for it during purchase.    6. Update: Apple Watch Edition is gone. Looks like its just Hermes on the upper end now 2. Fitness+: Unsurprising that Apple is getting into home fitness streaming. It's probably one of the fastest growing segments of services by a wide margin. Correct me if I am wrong, but Fitness+ is the lowest entry price point out of any of the currently available fitness services because since the tracking is all done on Apple Watch, you don't need to buy the specific workout hardware that other home fitness services need for certain workouts. Seems like an overall better way to approach things. Weird that they aren't doing scheduled live workouts like Peloton and others. Feels like it is an early step though so I expect them to grow the service quickly to be competitive. 3. Apple One: These prices are actually amazing, especially for the family plans. I can justify getting the services like Apple Arcade and News+ that I am curious about but wouldn't shell out for standalone subscription. I am glad iCloud is included in all of the plans. 5GB default storage is a massive pain point for everyone I know. 4. iPad 8th Gen: Apple does a victory lap (again). They keep doing these. 5. iPad Air: Basically the stuff from the Pro everyone wants but without the Pro price tag. Big screen, stereo speakers, Pro accessories, $600. I'm conflicted now if I want this or the Pro and will wait to see how the A14 stacks up against A12Z to decide. Nice to have: ships with 20W USB-C charger, but Apple needs to get to work on GaN chargers already. 6. Did Jony accidentally take the engineering docs for AirTags with him when he left? Can Tim call him and ask for them back? Imagine being CEO of Tile and living in oppressive fear of the next keynote because ""It could be the one where AirTags gets launched and rips our business in half""  When they finished all of the announcements in an hour, I was kind of hoping against reason for a 'One more thing.' But remember what John Gruber says; ""If they only have an hour of story to tell about the new products, the event will last only an hour. There’s an upper limit of just over two hours on event duration, but there’s no lower limit.""",157,1600193659.0

The PulseOx is cool but not $400 cool for me.

The iPad Air is the best thing announced IMO and the most tempting for me. I’ve got the second gen Pro and it is a little wonky and slow now. I’ll miss the 120Hz display, but honestly I’ll miss the idea of it more than any actual benefits it gave. I honestly can’t tell much of a difference between it and my iPhone.   The Apple Watch stuff was weird though. The S6 was expected but as someone pointed out, the big feature of an blood oximeter can be handled by getting a cheap one off Amazon. And the focus they put on the always on display being better just shows how useless it is on the S5.   The SE should be $200. Keeping the S3 around is just cheap.",5,1600194187.0

MacOS is just having more and more bugs and doesn't support touch interfaces. They seem more interested in making stupid Apple watch workout apps for boomers.

Apple Watch:   •looks great, but I don’t need it! This is the kind of update that has me excited for when I do need a new Watch, because I’ll get the features of this watch, plus whatever comes next but for the time being my Series 4 is more than capable.   •blue and red look awesome, but I honestly can’t think of many outfits I’d be able to match with that. at the end of the day it’s still a watch, it’s an accessory you wear, I don’t want this bright red or deep blue thing sticking out on my wrist, personally. I’ll be sticking with space grey.   Apple Watch SE:  • home run. my girlfriend has been wanting an Apple Watch for a while and she doesn’t need all the fancy bells and whistles, but I couldn’t quite stomach getting her a Series 3 when it’ll be outdated soon and the design isn’t as pleasant as the Series 4 and above. not for me, but I definitely see the market.  • Apple Watch Family or whatever the hell it’s called:  don’t see myself ever using this, but had this been around a few years ago it would’ve been great for my great grandma who doesn’t need a phone, but could benefit from the health features and still be in contact with the family. I personally don’t think she’ll be around much longer, so I’m not sure if it’s worth it for her to hop into this now, but a great idea. (also, don’t be sad! she’s lived a great life and is otherwise very healthy outside of her age!)  •Fitness+ isn’t for me because I ride my bike, I golf, hike, lift the occasional weight, etc, but for someone like my mom who likes to watch dance workout videos and loves her Apple TV, this seems like a no brainer.   iPad:  •iPad  •again, home run. you just cannot beat that value. decent screen size, Pencil support, decent specs, you cannot beat that value, especially if you get education pricing. in the age of COVID, I can see this being very popular, even moreso than the current iPad.   •iPad Air  •YES, YES, AND YES!! I’ve been dying for a device like this. don’t need a Pro, but I want more than the base iPad and this is the bee’s knees. very excited to just have a slab of glass to take notes on with no bezels in the way. kinda hoping this version of Touch ID makes it’s way to iPhone. I love Face ID, but it’s incredibly inconvenient with having to wear masks and I’d be happy to go back to Touch ID if this is how they’re going to do it. loving that green color too.   •I mentioned it in another comment, but if you’re planning on buying this go to the Apple refurbished store right now and get $20 off an Apple Pencil 2 before they sell out! I know the savings seem kinda small, but it basically covers the tax for the Pencil and from what I hear Apple Refurbished products are just as good as new ones.   overall, a decent conference if you’re in the market for either a Watch or an iPad, but I can definitely see why this is disappointing if you’re waiting for the phone. My XS is running great on iOS 14 and I just paid it off so I think I’m gonna use it another year and instead put my money towards an iPad Air.",1,1600195469.0

My cousin bought his 70-something year old mother an Apple Watch, and asked me, the go to device person in the family, to set it up for her. I asked if she had an iPhone. Nope. It got returned.   My mother is in her 60s, widowed, and lives alone. She has tripped before doing things like taking out the trash in icy weather. She has an Android phone that she can only just manage to make and receive calls on. I have asked her to keep her phone on her when she's doing errands, going in the basement, working outside. She can never remember. The Apple Watch and a pair of airpods could replace her phone and always be on her.   At a family function recently a priest in his 80s shared how his niece got him an Apple Watch. The very next week he fell and home badly enough that he needed stiches. The watch caught the fall and went into SOS mode. Thankfully he was with his sister and she was able to drive him to the ER. The Apple Watch really is protecting older people.",0,1600219523.0

If they’re not gonna make their own car, they’re going to team up with Toyota or Honda and let them handle the car stuff, just like they did with the Apple Card. Then it pretty much became a smear campaign against Prosser and his intent became clear (I’m not invalidating the stuff he brought up, but just saying that it’s very fishy how he came out of no where, got so much attention, and instantly went against Prosser).

This is especially handy since Apple devices will create this sort of “mesh” network, allowing you to pretty much triangulate your lost item. It will apparently have lots of AR integration, apparently you can use your iPhone to find it under couches and shit.  It will be big, and inspire a lot of competition.

It'll last you 3-4 years at least, so 100 dollars isn't really all that much over that period for what you're getting (20*365*4 = 29 200 times you're not annoyed at your watch not showing the time)",3,1600203256.0
1166,g5hktcm,t1_g5havgs,userlivewire,"“My kid didn’t steal anything from you and if you call me again I’ll call the police for harassment”   The watch can’t communicate if it’s not within range of your device. I don’t think that Find My will just send the location through a random person’s phone from inside their house. I know the service sounds like it might do that but I don’t think it would work.   I would say that the watch is MORE likely to get stolen because it’s out where other bully kids can see it. The watch is also something many of the other kids don’t have, unlock phones. To your last point, kids don’t ways have an incentive or a plan at all. They can just take the watch off your kid’s arm and throw it in a storm drain because they’re jerks.",1,1600275677.0

1174,g5fomny,t1_g5fjz0d,Greninja55,"That’s true. I wonder if the power button will have a different functionality. When Touch ID was on the home button, pressing it would take you to the Home Screen. The power butting was for bringing up the Lock Screen without going into it, like reading messages.   If you have to use the power button and then swipe up from the bottom of the screen, I think that definitely makes it worse than Face ID, and not much better than using the passcode when Face ID fails.

And they school kids for shit they do outside of school all the time. I knew kids in high school get expelled for stealing phones back when they were cheap Motorolas. Plus word gets around in school communities and nobody wants to be the known as the family with the kid who steals shit. This is not high crime here. People handle stuff like this all the time.   Kids have stolen shit for no reason since the beginning of time and there's literally nothing we can do about it.  They're way more likely to be catfishes and bullied online by their peers than being strung up by their underwear for their lunch money these days.
