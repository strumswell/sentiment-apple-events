        "I remember the Intel transition so well. It was so hyped and hotly anticipated. Rightly so.   Looking back though, it feels like today has the potential to be a more significant event for the industry.   2005 was a consolidation. In 2004, Mac (and broadly by extension PowerPC) had less than 3% market share. They were joining the 95% of other computers on Intel.   Apple Silicon is a departure. The creation of what might be a mass-market, alternative architecture. Macs still haven\u2019t cracked 10% market share. But if Apple can offer same performance, cheaper, with 150% battery life, for the first time since the emergence of the wintel monopoly, there is a small chance of real disruption.",

That means that while Apple events normally start at 19:00 in most of Europe, **today\u2019s event starts at 18:00** and what is written in the OP is incorrect.

        "Everything I\u2019ve read has said that Tim Cook has been pushing for Apple to become a services company for **years.**  But we\u2019re not just talking about offering a service: rather, Apple is actually producing their own content.   Making their own TV shows and movies is a risky move. It has literally cost the company **BILLIONS** of dollars.  And they\u2019re playable on any ol\u2019 smart tv.  That\u2019s a big shift coming from the company that cares so much about the user experience it makes its own hardware and software. Now you can just get their stuff anywhere, huh?  If this initiative doesn\u2019t pay off, I think it\u2019s safe to say we will see a major leadership change at Apple in the next three or four years.",

        "If they\u2019re introducing a gaming service, Apple desperately needs to introduce their own hardware controller.  I know it sounds silly, but Apple would be taken more seriously for games if they offered their own controller that seamlessly connected to iOS devices and Apple TV as easily as AirPods do.  No one wants to hunt down a MFI controller. I don\u2019t know anyone \u2014 not one damn person \u2014 that owns one. Most people probably don\u2019t even know that they\u2019re offered by third-parties.  And besides, on consoles, no one likes cheap off-brand controllers anyway.  Until an official, bone fide Apple controller is introduced, the company will remain an afterthought in gaming \u2014 a mobile gaming company only. Yes, there is money in that. But you know as well as I do they\u2019re going to show off \u201cconsole-level\u201d graphics and whatever else tomorrow, and it\u2019ll be worthless if it doesn\u2019t have an official console-level controller to support them.",

They were the first US company in history to be valued at one trillion dollars. They can afford to throw $10 billion in a new venture and see if it pays off. They lose very little if it doesn't.  Tim Cook's genius has always been in making Apple's hardware supply chain lean and profitable. He's unlikely to be fired no matter what happens with Apple media.",

Oftentimes it'd be new hardware announced today, but they already did that 3 days in a row last week.  Nobody knows what will be introduced or how cool it will be.   Will it be awesome, or will look like a dud from the get-go?  Of course, all that doesn't mean it's exciting to you.  Just giving some perspective as to why it may be exciting to others.",
